## Compatibility Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Current test commands work perfectly
just test              # Python test suite
just lint              # Code quality checks
just services          # Integration testing
```

### Pre-upgrade Testing (For React 19)
```bash
# Recommended testing approach
npm run test           # React component tests
npm run build          # Production build verification
just services-dev      # Live development testing
```
