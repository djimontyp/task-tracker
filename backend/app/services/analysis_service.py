"""Analysis service - DEPRECATED, use app.services.analysis instead.

This module provides backward compatibility for imports.
The service has been split into focused modules:
- analysis_validator.py: Validation logic
- analysis_crud.py: CRUD operations
- analysis_executor.py: Execution orchestration

All imports are re-exported from app.services.analysis package.
