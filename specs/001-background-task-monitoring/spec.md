# Feature Specification: Background Task Monitoring System

**Feature Branch**: `001-background-task-monitoring`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Background Task Monitoring System - real-time dashboard для моніторингу 15 TaskIQ worker tasks. Показує health status (active/queue/success/failed), live activity feed через WebSocket, task history з фільтрами, error investigation з deталями, performance metrics. Базується на готовому UX/UI дизайні з повним описом API endpoints, database schema, frontend компонентів. MVP Phase 1: Overview tab + Health cards + Live feed + History table."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer or DevOps engineer, I need to monitor the health and performance of background tasks in real-time so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues with message processing, knowledge extraction, and task execution without digging through logs or database queries.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the monitoring dashboard is open, **When** a background task starts executing, **Then** I see the task status change to "running" in real-time without page refresh
2. **Given** a background task has failed, **When** I view the task history, **Then** I can see the error message, stack trace, and task parameters to debug the issue
3. **Given** multiple tasks are executing, **When** I view the overview dashboard, **Then** I see health cards showing current status counts (active, queued, success, failed) for all 15 task types
4. **Given** I want to investigate recent failures, **When** I apply filters to the history table (e.g., status=failed, date range), **Then** I see only tasks matching those criteria
5. **Given** tasks are being processed continuously, **When** I view the live activity feed, **Then** I see new task events appear in real-time via WebSocket updates

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a task execution takes longer than expected (timeout scenario)?
- How does the system handle tasks that fail repeatedly (retry logic visibility)?
- What happens when WebSocket connection is lost (reconnection and missed updates)?
- How are very old task execution logs handled (data retention)?
- What happens when multiple tasks of the same type run concurrently?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Monitoring Capabilities:**
- **FR-001**: System MUST display real-time health status for all 15 background task types
- **FR-002**: System MUST show task execution counts broken down by status (active, queued, success, failed)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a live activity feed showing task events as they occur
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain a searchable history of all task executions
- **FR-005**: System MUST capture and display error details (message, stack trace, parameters) for failed tasks

**Real-Time Updates:**
- **FR-006**: System MUST broadcast task status changes via WebSocket to connected clients
- **FR-007**: System MUST update health metrics automatically when tasks start, complete, or fail
- **FR-008**: Dashboard MUST reflect task state changes within 1 second of occurrence

**Task History & Investigation:**
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow filtering task history by task type, status, and date range
- **FR-010**: System MUST display task execution duration for performance analysis
- **FR-011**: System MUST show task parameters and input data for debugging purposes
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide pagination for task history (max 50 records per page)

**Performance Metrics:**
- **FR-013**: System MUST calculate and display average execution time per task type
- **FR-014**: System MUST track success/failure rates over time
- **FR-015**: System MUST show queue depth (pending tasks) for each task type

**Data Management:**
- **FR-016**: System MUST persist task execution logs for at least 30 days
- **FR-017**: System MUST automatically archive or delete logs older than retention period

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- **NFR-001**: Dashboard MUST load initial data within 2 seconds
- **NFR-002**: WebSocket updates MUST have latency under 100ms
- **NFR-003**: History queries MUST return results within 500ms for date ranges up to 7 days

**Reliability:**
- **NFR-004**: Task tracking MUST not interfere with actual task execution performance
- **NFR-005**: System MUST handle WebSocket disconnections gracefully with automatic reconnection
- **NFR-006**: Task logging MUST be resilient to database connection issues (queue writes if needed)

**Scalability:**
- **NFR-007**: System MUST support monitoring up to 1000 concurrent task executions
- **NFR-008**: History storage MUST handle at least 1 million task execution records

### Key Entities

- **Task Execution Log**: Records of individual task runs, including task name, status (pending/running/success/failed), start time, end time, duration, error message, stack trace, and input parameters
- **Task Type**: Represents one of the 15 background task types (e.g., knowledge extraction, message scoring, webhook processing), with associated health metrics
- **Health Metrics**: Aggregated statistics per task type showing counts of active, queued, successful, and failed executions
- **Activity Event**: Real-time event representing a task state change, used for live feed updates

## Clarifications

### Session 1 (2025-10-27)

**Q1: Which 15 TaskIQ background tasks should be monitored?**
A: All tasks defined in `backend/app/tasks.py`: knowledge extraction tasks (extract_knowledge_from_messages_task, extract_topic_and_atoms_task, generate_topic_summary_task), message scoring (score_message_task), webhook processing (save_telegram_message), and other analysis tasks.

**Q2: What level of error detail is needed for debugging?**
A: Full error message, stack trace, task input parameters (JSON), and timestamp. Enough information to reproduce the failure without accessing logs or database directly.

**Q3: What task statuses should be tracked?**
A: Four states: pending (queued but not started), running (actively executing), success (completed successfully), failed (exception occurred). Map to TaskIQ's internal states.

**Q4: How should performance metrics be calculated?**
A: Average execution time = sum(duration) / count(success), calculated per task type. Success rate = count(success) / count(total), calculated over last 24 hours by default.

**Q5: What happens to old task execution logs?**
A: Retain for 30 days, then automatically archive to cold storage or delete. Configurable retention period via environment variable.
