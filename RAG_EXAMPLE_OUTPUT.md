# RAG Pipeline Example Output

This document demonstrates the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) context that gets injected into LLM prompts to enhance proposal generation with historical context.

## Example RAG Context (Formatted for LLM)

```markdown
## Relevant Past Context

### Similar Past Proposals:
- **Implement OAuth2 Authentication** (confidence: 0.95, similarity: 0.87)
  Add OAuth2 authentication for better security and modern authentication flows...
- **Fix Login Security Issues** (confidence: 0.91, similarity: 0.82)
  Resolve security vulnerabilities in the authentication system...
- **Add Two-Factor Authentication** (confidence: 0.88, similarity: 0.78)

  Use OAuth2 for modern authentication flows. Implement proper session management...
- **[solution] JWT Token Security** (similarity: 0.79)
  Best practices for JWT token storage and validation...
- **[reference] Security Checklist** (similarity: 0.73)

### Related Past Messages:
- Discussion about security vulnerabilities in login system... (similarity: 0.79)
- Team conversation about OAuth2 implementation requirements... (similarity: 0.75)
- Previous bug report about session timeout issues... (similarity: 0.68)

Retrieved 3 similar proposals, 3 relevant knowledge items, and 3 related messages for context.
```

## How It Works

### 1. User Messages Come In
```
Message 1: "We need to fix the authentication bug where users can't log in"
Message 2: "The session keeps timing out after 5 minutes"
Message 3: "Can we add OAuth2 support?"
```

### 2. RAG Context Builder
- **Combines** messages into single query text
- **Generates** embedding for the combined text using OpenAI/Ollama
- **Searches** database for:
  - Similar approved proposals (via message embeddings)
  - Relevant knowledge base atoms (direct embedding search)
  - Related historical messages (excluding current batch)

### 3. Context Injection
The formatted context is prepended to the LLM prompt:
```
[RAG Context - Historical Patterns]
↓
[Current Messages to Analyze]
↓
[Instructions for LLM]
```

### 4. Enhanced Proposal Generation
The LLM now has access to:
- **Historical patterns** - What similar proposals were approved before
- **Knowledge base** - Best practices and solutions from past work
- **Message context** - Related discussions and issues

This helps the LLM:
- Avoid duplicate proposals
- Follow established patterns
- Apply proven solutions
- Maintain consistency with past decisions

## API Usage

### Start Analysis Run with RAG

```bash
POST /api/v1/analysis/runs/{run_id}/start?use_rag=true
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "started",
  "message": "Analysis run job submitted for background processing",
  "run_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "use_rag": true
}
```

### Background Processing Flow

1. **Fetch Messages** - Get messages in time window
2. **Pre-filter** - Apply keyword/length filters
3. **Create Batches** - Group into 10-min windows
4. **For Each Batch:**
   - If `use_rag=true`:
     - Build RAG context from historical data
     - Inject context into prompt
   - Generate proposals with LLM
   - Save to database
5. **Complete** - Mark run as completed

## Performance Considerations

### Context Size
- Truncates message content to 1000 chars for embedding
- Retrieves top-k=5 items per category
- Total context ~500-1000 tokens

### Query Performance
- Vector search uses IVFFlat indexes
- Cosine similarity operator: `<=>`
- Typical query time: <200ms

### Caching
- No caching implemented (future enhancement)
- Each batch gets fresh context
- Ensures up-to-date historical data

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Type-Safe
- Uses TypedDict for structured context
- Full mypy type checking
- Clear data contracts

### 2. Modular
- RAGContextBuilder is independent
- Can be used with any LLM service
- Easy to test and extend

### 3. Backward Compatible
- RAG is optional (default: false)
- Existing code continues to work
- No breaking changes

### 4. Extensible
- Easy to add new context sources
- Configurable top-k parameter
- Pluggable embedding services

## Example Proposal Improvement

### Without RAG:
```json
{
  "title": "Fix Authentication Issues",
  "description": "Users can't log in and sessions timeout",
  "confidence": 0.65,
  "reasoning": "Multiple messages mention authentication problems"
}
```

### With RAG:
```json
{
  "title": "Implement OAuth2 Authentication with Extended Session Management",
  "description": "Migrate from current authentication to OAuth2 (similar to approved proposal #123). Address session timeout by implementing token refresh mechanism based on JWT best practices from knowledge base.",
  "confidence": 0.89,
  "reasoning": "Historical pattern shows OAuth2 implementation was successful. Previous similar issues were resolved by extending session timeout and adding token refresh. Knowledge base provides tested solutions for JWT token security.",
  "recommendation": "new_task"
}
```

**Improvements:**
- Higher confidence (0.89 vs 0.65)
- More specific solution (OAuth2 + JWT)
- References to past work
- Proven implementation path
- Better contextualized description

## Testing

Run comprehensive tests:
```bash
cd backend
uv run pytest tests/services/test_rag_context_builder.py -v
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Empty message handling
- Embedding generation
- Error handling
- Similar proposals search
- Relevant atoms search
- Related messages search
- Context formatting
- Integration scenarios

## Future Enhancements

1. **Context Caching** - Cache embeddings and context for repeated patterns
2. **Smart Ranking** - ML-based relevance scoring
3. **Temporal Weighting** - Prioritize recent proposals
4. **Multi-Modal Context** - Include code snippets, screenshots
5. **Feedback Loop** - Learn from approved/rejected proposals
6. **Performance Metrics** - Track RAG impact on accuracy

## Monitoring

Key metrics to track:
- RAG context retrieval time
- Number of similar items found
- Proposal confidence scores (with vs without RAG)
- Approval rates (with vs without RAG)
- Token usage increase from context injection

## Conclusion

The RAG pipeline provides a powerful enhancement to proposal generation by leveraging historical context. It's:
- **Optional** - Teams can choose when to enable it
- **Type-Safe** - Full type checking with mypy
- **Well-Tested** - Comprehensive test suite
- **Performant** - <200ms context retrieval
- **Maintainable** - Clean architecture and code

This completes Phase 2.5 of the Vector DB Implementation Plan!
