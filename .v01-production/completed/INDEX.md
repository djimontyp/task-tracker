## Recommendations

### Next Actions (Immediate)

1. **Review Completion** (1 hour)
   - Read `feature-1-pgvector/SUMMARY.md` (5-min overview)
   - Validate metrics in progress tracking
   - Verify system is functioning

2. **Plan Feature 2** (4 hours)
   - Read `../audits/frontend/ux-ui-expert-report.md`
   - Identify quick wins (WCAG fixes)
   - Prioritize highest-impact accessibility issues

3. **Communicate Progress** (1 hour)
   - Share pgvector completion to stakeholders
   - Update project status
   - Set Feature 2 expectations

### Strategic Recommendations

1. **Continue High-Priority Features** (Weeks 1-3)
   - Features 1-5 unlock demo-readiness
   - Estimated 55-66 hours total
   - Should complete by week 3 (2025-11-14)

2. **Defer Lower-Priority Work** (Post-MVP)
   - Feature 6 (auth) can wait until sale is likely
   - Performance optimization can be post-launch
   - Advanced features (hybrid search) can be phase 2

3. **Maintain Momentum**
   - Feature 1 took 6-8 hours - good velocity
   - Learned what works (batched work, clear documentation)
   - Apply same pattern to Features 2-5

### Documentation Improvements

1. **Keep Original Audits** (unchanged)
   - `.v01-production/audits/` preserved for reference
   - Links to specific findings in completion docs

2. **Reference This Directory** (for tracking)
   - All completed work goes to `.v01-production/completed/`
   - Links to original audit + implementation details
   - PROGRESS.md tracks overall status

3. **Update Epic After Each Feature**
   - `.artifacts/product-ready-epic/progress.md`
   - Mark Feature 2-6 status as they complete
   - Keep timeline updated
