# Production Readiness Progress - v0.1 Epic

**Tracking Period**: 2025-10-27 to present
**Overall Status**: In Progress (1/6 Features Complete)
**Current Readiness**: 6.8/10 → Target: 9.0/10 (by end of week 3)

---

## Completed Features

### Feature 1: Core LLM Infrastructure (pgvector)
**Status**: COMPLETED and VALIDATED
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-28
**Priority**: P0 BLOCKER
**Effort Invested**: 6-8 hours

**What was fixed**:
- Vector index infrastructure (2 HNSW indexes)
- Embedding generation (362 embeddings backfilled, 100% coverage)
- Auto-embedding pipeline (active in extract_knowledge_from_messages_task)
- Query performance (sequential scans → index-based less than 50ms)

**Audit Score**: D- (20/100) → A (95/100)

**Blockers Resolved**:
1. ✓ pgvector indexes created
2. ✓ 0 embeddings → 362 embeddings (100% coverage)
3. ✓ No auto-pipeline → auto-embedding active
4. ✓ Sequential scans → HNSW index scans

**Impact on Product**:
- Knowledge extraction now works end-to-end
- Semantic search functional
- Foundation for Features 2-5

**Documentation**: `.v01-production/completed/feature-1-pgvector/`

**Next Steps**: Can now proceed to Feature 2 (UX/Accessibility)

## Risk Log

### Completed Feature 1

**Risk**: pgvector index build fails due to OOM
**Status**: MITIGATED
**Resolution**: Created indexes CONCURRENTLY, increased maintenance_work_mem to 256MB

**Risk**: Embedding backfill costs exceed budget
**Status**: RESOLVED
**Actual Cost**: $0.0007 (negligible)

---

### Upcoming Features

**Risk 2.1**: TypeScript errors block UX fixes
**Mitigation Plan**: Fix top-impact errors first (52 total), can iterate

**Risk 3.1**: Feature consistency uncovers more issues
**Mitigation Plan**: Iterative approach - fix one flow at a time

**Risk 4.1**: Test fixes reveal deeper architecture issues
**Mitigation Plan**: Prioritize core flow tests, refactor incrementally

**Risk 5.1**: Resilience changes impact performance
**Mitigation Plan**: Load test after each change, have rollback plan
