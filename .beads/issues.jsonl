{"id":"task-tracker-zrv","title":"WS-1: Refactor AppSidebar WebSocket - замінити raw WS на useWebSocket hook","description":"## Problem\nAppSidebar використовує raw `new WebSocket()` замість існуючого `useWebSocket` hook.\n\n**Файл:** `frontend/src/shared/components/AppSidebar/index.tsx`\n**Рядки:** 111-160\n\n### Поточні проблеми:\n- ❌ Немає reconnection logic\n- ❌ Немає ping timeout handling (dead connection detection)\n- ❌ Event handlers не очищуються (memory leak)\n- ❌ Залежність на `queryClient` в useEffect deps\n\n## Solution\nЗамінити raw WebSocket на `useWebSocket` hook з `@/shared/hooks`.\n\n### Код для заміни (lines 111-160):\n```tsx\nuseWebSocket({\n  topics: ['analysis', 'proposals', 'noise_filtering'],\n  onMessage: (data) =\u003e {\n    const message = data as { topic: string; event: string }\n    const { topic, event: eventType } = message\n\n    if (topic === 'analysis' \u0026\u0026 ['run_created', 'run_closed', 'run_failed'].includes(eventType)) {\n      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['sidebar-counts'] })\n    }\n    if (topic === 'proposals' \u0026\u0026 ['proposal_created', 'proposal_approved', 'proposal_rejected'].includes(eventType)) {\n      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['sidebar-counts'] })\n    }\n    if (topic === 'noise_filtering' \u0026\u0026 ['message_scored', 'batch_scored'].includes(eventType)) {\n      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['sidebar-counts'] })\n    }\n  },\n  reconnect: true,\n})\n```\n\n### Зміни:\n1. Додати import: `import { useWebSocket } from '@/shared/hooks'`\n2. Видалити import: `import { getWebSocketUrl } from '@/shared/utils/websocket'`\n3. Видалити useEffect з raw WebSocket (lines 111-160)\n4. Додати useWebSocket hook виклик\n\n## Benefits\n- ✅ Automatic reconnection (exponential backoff, max 5 attempts)\n- ✅ Ping timeout detection (45s)\n- ✅ Proper cleanup on unmount\n- ✅ Connection state tracking\n\n## Verification\n1. `cd frontend \u0026\u0026 npx tsc --noEmit`\n2. `npm run lint`\n3.
