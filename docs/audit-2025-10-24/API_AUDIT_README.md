## Key Findings

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

1. **Parameter Mismatch** `provider_id` → `agent_config_id`
   - All documented examples will fail
   - Breaking change for integration

2. **Missing Period-Based Selection Feature**
   - 50% of API capability undocumented
   - Very useful for automated extractions

3. **Wrong WebSocket Endpoint**
   - Documented: `/ws/knowledge`
   - Actual: `/ws?topics=knowledge` (with subscription)
   - All documented examples fail to connect

4. **Undocumented Versioning System**
   - Automatic version creation for topics/atoms
   - New WebSocket event: `knowledge.version_created`
   - Version tracking invisible to users

5. **Incomplete Error Handling**
   - Status codes differ (422 → 400)
   - Provider errors → AgentConfig errors
   - Missing error cases in documentation

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
- [ ] Update `provider_id` → `agent_config_id` throughout docs
- [ ] Fix WebSocket endpoint in examples
- [ ] Document period-based selection
- [ ] Update error handling documentation

**Effort:** 4-6 hours

### Short Term (Priority 2)
- [ ] Document versioning system
- [ ] Add Topics/Atoms CRUD reference
- [ ] Fix all code examples
- [ ] Add validation rules table

**Effort:** 6-8 hours

### Medium Term (Priority 3)
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] AgentConfig relationship docs
- [ ] Status endpoints for jobs
- [ ] Migration guide

**Effort:** 8-10 hours

## Files Affected

### Documentation Files
- `/docs/content/en/api/knowledge.md` - Main documentation (NEEDS MAJOR UPDATE)
- `/docs/content/uk/api/knowledge.md` - Ukrainian translation (NEEDS MAJOR UPDATE)

### Implementation Files (For Reference)
- `/backend/app/api/v1/knowledge.py` - Knowledge API implementation
- `/backend/app/api/v1/topics.py` - Topics CRUD (not documented in knowledge.md)
- `/backend/app/api/v1/atoms.py` - Atoms CRUD (not documented in knowledge.md)
- `/backend/app/ws/router.py` - WebSocket implementation
- `/backend/app/tasks.py` - Background tasks with versioning logic
- `/backend/app/services/knowledge_extraction_service.py` - Extraction logic

---

## Severity Classification

### Critical (Must Fix)
- All 5 critical issues prevent successful API integration
- Examples in documentation are non-functional
- Core parameters are wrong

### High (Should Fix Soon)
- 3 major issues affect specific features
- Versioning system invisible to users
- Incomplete error handling

### Medium (Nice to Have)
- 2 minor issues improve documentation quality
- Better developer experience
- Complete feature discovery

---

## Conclusion

The Knowledge Extraction API is **well-implemented but poorly documented**. The codebase contains advanced features and proper error handling, but the documentation hasn't evolved with the implementation.

The most critical issues are:
1. Parameter name change not updated in docs
2. WebSocket endpoint structure completely different
3. 50% of capabilities undocumented
4. Examples are non-functional

**Recommendation:** Prioritize fixing critical issues (4-6 hours work) to restore documentation accuracy, then schedule short-term improvements (6-8 hours) to document missing features.
