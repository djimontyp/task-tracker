# Context Spaces (Topics)

## What are Context Spaces?

**Context Spaces** (also referred to as Topics) are the central organizing concept in Task Tracker. They represent contextual domains that aggregate and structure all project-related information in one place.

Unlike traditional task management systems where tasks are the primary entity, in Task Tracker, **Context Spaces serve as the central hub** for organizing knowledge, activities, and artifacts.

## Core Concept

A Context Space is not just a category or label - it's a **living knowledge container** that:

- Accumulates information from various sources
- Maintains context and relationships
- Evolves as new information arrives
- Serves as the foundation for AI analysis and automation

Think of Context Spaces as smart folders that understand their contents and can be enriched automatically.

## What Can Belong to a Context Space?

A Context Space can contain heterogeneous entities:

- **Tasks** - actionable items that need to be completed
- **Messages** - chat messages, discussions, conversations
- **Analysis Results** - structured data extracted by AI
- **Reports** - generated summaries and insights
- **External References** - links to Jira tickets, GitHub issues, Redmine tasks
- **Documentation** - notes, specs, decision records
- **Code References** - links to specific code locations

## Hierarchical Structure

Context Spaces can be organized hierarchically:

```
Project: Mobile App Redesign
  ├─ Component: Authentication
  │   ├─ Feature: OAuth Integration
  │   └─ Feature: Password Reset
  └─ Component: UI/UX
      ├─ Feature: Dark Mode
      └─ Feature: Responsive Layout
```

This allows for:
- Granular organization
- Inheritance of properties
- Contextual scoping
- Flexible navigation

## AI-Powered Knowledge Enrichment

When new information enters the system (message, task, event), the AI pipeline:

1. **Extracts structured data** from raw content
2. **Identifies relevant Context Space(s)** using semantic analysis
3. **Updates the Context Space** with new information
4. **Creates relationships** between related spaces
5. **Triggers actions** based on context changes

Example flow:

```
User sends message: "We need to fix the login bug on iOS"
    ↓
AI Analysis extracts:
  - Type: Bug
  - Component: Authentication
  - Platform: iOS
  - Action: Fix required
    ↓
AI finds Context Space: "Mobile App → Authentication"
    ↓
Updates Context Space:
  - Adds bug to issues list
  - Links to related messages
  - Updates status metrics
  - Triggers notification to responsible team
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Project Management
Track entire project lifecycle within its Context Space:
- Planning documents
- Tasks and milestones
- Team discussions
- Progress reports

### 2. Knowledge Base
Build living documentation:
- Decisions made over time
- Technical discussions
- Solutions to problems
- Best practices discovered

### 3. Integration Hub
Synchronize with external systems:
- Create Jira issues from Context Space tasks
- Import GitHub issues into relevant spaces
- Export reports to project management tools

### 4. Analytics Engine
Generate insights based on Context Space data:
- Time spent per component
- Bottlenecks identification
- Team productivity metrics
- Trend analysis

## Context Space Lifecycle

### Active
Currently being worked on, accumulating information, AI actively processing new data.

### Archived
Historical record, searchable but not actively updated.

### Connected
Linked to other spaces, information can flow between them.

## Benefits

1. **Unified View** - All related information in one place
2. **Smart Organization** - AI maintains structure automatically
3. **Knowledge Retention** - History and context preserved
4. **Flexible Integration** - Connect any external tools
5. **Contextual Intelligence** - AI understands project context

## Technical Implementation

Context Spaces are implemented as:
- Database entities with flexible schema
- Graph of relationships between spaces
- Event-driven updates via TaskIQ workers
- WebSocket real-time notifications
- AI analysis pipeline for enrichment

## Best Practices

1. **Start broad, refine as needed** - Create general spaces first, split into sub-spaces when they grow
2. **Let AI help** - Allow the system to suggest space assignments
3. **Review relationships** - Periodically check that spaces are properly connected
4. **Archive completed work** - Keep active spaces focused on current work
5. **Use hierarchies wisely** - Don't over-nest, 2-3 levels is usually enough

## Future Directions

- Automatic space creation based on patterns
- Cross-space search and analytics
- Space templates for common project types
- AI-generated space summaries
- Collaborative space editing
