## System Overview

The versioning system provides audit trail and approval workflow for AI-generated updates to Topics and Atoms. When the knowledge extraction service detects changes to existing entities, it creates unapproved version snapshots that require human review before being applied.

### Purpose

**Change Control:** Prevent automatic AI updates from overwriting curated knowledge:
- Knowledge extraction runs continuously on incoming messages
- Updates to existing Topics/Atoms are captured as versions
- Human reviewers approve or reject proposed changes
- Only approved versions modify the main entities

**Audit Trail:** Complete history of all proposed and approved changes:
- Each version stores a complete snapshot of entity data
- Version creation tracked with timestamp and creator
- Approval tracked with timestamp (approved_by field pending)
- Rejection leaves version in draft state

### When Versions Are Created

**Automatic Triggers:**
1. Knowledge extraction detects update to existing Topic (name/description/icon/color)
2. Knowledge extraction detects update to existing Atom (type/content/title/confidence/meta)
3. Version created with `created_by="knowledge_extraction"` and `approved=false`

**Manual Triggers:**
- Not currently supported (no API endpoints for manual version creation)

### Version Numbering

**Sequential Integer System:**
- Versions start at 1 for each entity
- Each new version increments: `latest_version.version + 1`
- Version numbers are entity-specific (Topic #5 can have v1-v10, Atom #7 can have v1-v3)
- Gaps in sequence indicate deleted versions (not currently implemented)

## Approval Workflow

### State Diagram

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft: Version Created<br/>(approved=false)

    Draft --> Approved: POST /versions/{id}/approve
    Draft --> Rejected: POST /versions/{id}/reject

    Approved --> [*]: Entity Updated<br/>approved=true<br/>approved_at=NOW
    Rejected --> [*]: Entity Unchanged<br/>approved=false<br/>approved_at=NULL

    note right of Draft
        Created by knowledge extraction
        Awaits human review
    end note

    note right of Approved
        Changes applied to main entity
        Version marked as approved
    end note

    note right of Rejected
        No changes to entity
        Version stays unapproved
    end note
```

### Workflow Steps

**Draft → Approve:**
1. Reviewer fetches version diff to compare changes
2. Reviewer approves version via API
3. System applies version data to main entity (Topic or Atom)
4. System sets `version.approved = true`
5. System sets `version.approved_at = <current timestamp>`
6. Entity changes are immediately visible to all users

**Draft → Reject:**
1. Reviewer fetches version diff to understand changes
2. Reviewer rejects version via API
3. **No changes applied to main entity**
4. Version remains in database with `approved=false`
5. Version can be re-reviewed or deleted later

## Version States

### State Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Draft Value | Approved Value | Rejected Value |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| `approved` | Boolean | Approval status | `false` | `true` | `false` |
| `approved_at` | DateTime(TZ) | Approval timestamp | `NULL` | `<timestamp>` | `NULL` |

### Entity Update Behavior

**Approval Applies Changes:**

When a version is approved, the system updates the main entity (Topic or Atom) by applying all fields from `version.data`:

| Entity Type | Updated Fields |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Topic** | `name`, `description`, `icon`, `color` |
| **Atom** | `type`, `content`, `title`, `confidence`, `meta` |

**Rejection Preserves Entity:**

When a version is rejected:
- Main entity remains unchanged
- Version stays in database with `approved=false`
- No distinction between "rejected" and "awaiting review" (identified gap)

## Services Architecture

### VersioningService

**Purpose:** Core versioning logic for create, approve, reject, diff operations

**Key Responsibilities:**

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `create_topic_version(db, topic_id, data, created_by)` | Create new topic version snapshot |
| `create_atom_version(db, atom_id, data, created_by)` | Create new atom version snapshot |
| `get_versions(db, entity_type, entity_id)` | Retrieve all versions for entity (newest first) |
| `get_version_diff(db, entity_type, entity_id, v1, v2)` | Generate diff between two versions using DeepDiff |
| `approve_version(db, entity_type, entity_id, version)` | Approve version and apply changes to entity |
| `reject_version(db, entity_type, entity_id, version)` | Reject version (no-op, returns unchanged version) |

**Version Creation Logic:**
1. Fetch latest version for entity (or default to v0 if none exist)
2. Increment version number: `latest_version.version + 1`
3. Create new version record with provided data snapshot
4. Set `approved=false`, `created_by=<creator>`, `created_at=NOW`
5. Commit to database

**Approval Logic:**
1. Fetch version by entity_id and version_number
2. Validate version exists and is not already approved
3. Fetch main entity (Topic or Atom)
4. Apply version data to entity using `setattr(entity, key, value)`
5. Set `version.approved = true`, `version.approved_at = NOW`
6. Commit transaction

**Diff Comparison:**
- Uses `DeepDiff` library to compare JSON snapshots
- Detects field changes, type changes, additions, removals
- Returns structured list of changes with old/new values

### KnowledgeExtractionService

**Purpose:** AI-powered entity extraction that auto-creates versions for updates

**Auto-Creation Triggers:**

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| New Topic extracted from messages | Create Topic directly (no version) |
| Existing Topic detected with changes | Create TopicVersion with `approved=false` |
| New Atom extracted from messages | Create Atom directly (no version) |
| Existing Atom detected with changes | Create AtomVersion with `approved=false` |

**Version Data Snapshots:**

For Topics:
- `name`, `description`, `icon`, `color`

For Atoms:
- `type`, `content`, `title`, `confidence`, `meta`

**Creator Attribution:**
- All auto-generated versions have `created_by="knowledge_extraction"`
- Distinguishes AI-generated versions from future manual versions

---

## Usage Patterns

### Who Creates Versions

**Current:**
- Knowledge extraction service (automatic AI updates)

**Future Potential:**
- Manual API for user-initiated updates
- Batch import tools
- External integrations

### Who Approves Versions

**Current:**
- Any API client with access to endpoints (no role-based permissions)

**Identified Gap:**
- No authentication/authorization checks
- No `approved_by` field to track approver identity
- No audit trail for approval decisions

**Workaround:**
- Frontend implements access control
- Trust-based system for small teams
- Review logs via `approved_at` timestamp

### How Versions Are Used

**Audit Trail:**
- Complete history of all proposed changes
- Reviewable via API (list versions, compare diffs)
- Retained indefinitely (no expiration policy)

**Change Control:**
- Prevents automatic overwrites of curated knowledge
- Human-in-the-loop workflow for AI updates
- Reject capability for incorrect AI suggestions

**Not Used For:**
- Filtering queries (system does not enforce "approved only" mode)
- Source of truth (main entities are used directly, not versions)
- Rollback (no direct rollback mechanism, see workaround below)

---

## Version Comparison

### Diff Engine

**Technology:** DeepDiff library for JSON comparison

**Supported Change Types:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `values_changed` | Field value modified | `description: "Old" → "New"` |
| `type_changes` | Field type changed | `confidence: 0.8 → "high"` |
| `dictionary_item_added` | New field added | `meta: null → {"tags": [...]}` |
| `dictionary_item_removed` | Field removed | `icon: "📝" → null` |

### Diff API Usage

**Compare version 2 to version 1:**

Endpoint: `GET /topics/{id}/versions/2/diff?compare_to=1`

Response shows changes from v1 → v2

**Compare current entity to version:**

Endpoint: `GET /topics/{id}/versions/0/diff?compare_to=3`

Version 0 represents current entity state

---

## System Gaps

### Identified Limitations

| Gap | Impact | Workaround |
|-----|--------|------------|
| **No role-based permissions** | Any API client can approve/reject | Frontend access control, trust-based system |
| **No `approved_by` field** | Cannot track who approved versions | Review `approved_at` timestamp, correlate with logs |
| **No rejection tracking** | Rejected versions indistinguishable from pending | Check `approved=false` and manually track decisions |
| **No rollback mechanism** | Cannot directly revert to previous version | Manually approve older version (creates new version number) |
| **No bulk operations** | Must approve/reject versions one-by-one | Iterate via API client |
| **No expiration policy** | Unapproved versions retained indefinitely | Manual cleanup via database |
| **No notification system** | No alerts for pending versions | Poll API for unapproved versions |

### Rollback Workaround

**Problem:** No direct rollback API endpoint

**Solution:** Manually approve older version

**Process:**
1. Identify target version to revert to (e.g., v3)
2. Approve that version: `POST /topics/{id}/versions/3/approve`
3. System applies v3 data to main entity
4. Version history shows v3 as latest approved version

**Caveat:** This creates a "revert" effect but does not remove newer versions from history

---

## Summary

### Version Lifecycle

**Creation → Draft → Review → Approval/Rejection**

1. Knowledge extraction detects change to existing entity
2. System creates version with `approved=false`
3. Dashboard displays pending versions
4. Reviewer compares diff
5. Reviewer approves (applies changes) or rejects (no changes)
6. Version marked with approval status and timestamp

### Current Capabilities

✅ Automatic version creation for AI updates
✅ Approval workflow with API endpoints
✅ Diff comparison between versions
✅ Complete audit trail of changes
✅ Sequential version numbering

❌ Role-based access control
❌ Approval/rejection tracking (`approved_by`, `rejected_by`)
❌ Direct rollback mechanism
❌ Bulk operations
❌ Expiration policies
