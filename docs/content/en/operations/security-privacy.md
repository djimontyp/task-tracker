## Security Overview

The Task Tracker implements **moderate security measures** focused on API key encryption, input validation, and HTTP security headers. The system is designed for **internal team use** within trusted networks and relies on network-level security with an Nginx reverse proxy.

!!! info "Current Security Status"
    - **Overall Rating:** MODERATE
    - **Authentication:** Not implemented (internal use)
    - **Encryption:** API keys (Fernet), Settings (AES-256-GCM)
    - **Transmission:** HTTP only (HTTPS template provided)
    - **Input Validation:** Strong (Pydantic models)

### Security Strengths

| Aspect | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **API Key Encryption** | ✅ Strong | Fernet symmetric encryption (AES-128-CBC with HMAC) |
| **Input Validation** | ✅ Strong | Pydantic model validation + Fastapi constraints |
| **SQL Injection Protection** | ✅ Strong | SQLAlchemy ORM parameterized queries |
| **HTTP Security Headers** | ✅ Implemented | CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options configured |
| **CORS Configuration** | ✅ Configurable | Restricted origins, specific methods allowed |

### Critical Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Impact |
|-----|----------|--------|
| **No User Authentication** | HIGH | All API consumers have full access |
| **No Rate Limiting** | HIGH | Susceptible to DoS attacks on public endpoints |
| **HTTP Only (Development)** | HIGH | No TLS encryption in development mode |
| **No Data Retention Policy** | HIGH | Privacy/GDPR compliance risk |
| **No Webhook Signature Verification** | MEDIUM | Telegram webhook vulnerable to unauthorized calls |

---

## Authentication & Authorization

### Current State: Internal Use Only

The Task Tracker is designed for **internal team use** and does not implement a user authentication system. All API endpoints are accessible without credentials, relying on network-level security.

!!! warning "Design Assumption"
    This system assumes deployment within a trusted internal network. If exposing to external users, authentication must be implemented before production use.

### API Access Model

**No authentication required** for API endpoints because:
- System is designed for team/internal use
- Network protection via Nginx reverse proxy
- Telegram bot token security handled by Telegram
- All team members have equivalent access needs

### Telegram Webhook Security

The Telegram webhook endpoint receives messages from Telegram's infrastructure:

**Current Implementation:**
- Relies on **bot token secrecy** for webhook security
- No webhook signature verification implemented
- Network-level protection via Nginx reverse proxy

**Gap:** Webhook endpoint could receive unauthorized requests if bot token is exposed.

### Future Authentication Requirements

If the system expands to multi-user or external access:

| Component | Recommendation | Priority |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **API Authentication** | Implement API key + token authentication | HIGH |
| **Webhook Verification** | Add Telegram signature verification | HIGH |
| **Role-Based Access** | Add permission system for multi-tenant | MEDIUM |
| **WebSocket Auth** | Add token-based auth for real-time updates | MEDIUM |

## Data Security

### Encryption Methods

The system uses multiple encryption approaches for different data types:

| Data Type | Encryption Method | Details | Key Management |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|-----------------|
| **API Keys** | Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC) | Symmetric encryption before storage | Single key in `.env` |
| **Settings Data** | AES-256-GCM | PBKDF2 key derivation (100k iterations) | `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var |
| **User Messages** | None | Stored plaintext in database | N/A |
| **User PII** | None | Names, emails, phones stored plaintext | N/A |

!!! tip "Encryption Status"
    Sensitive credentials are encrypted (API keys, provider secrets). User messages and PII are **not encrypted at rest**—depending on your privacy requirements, consider encryption for plaintext data in production deployments.

### Database Security

**PostgreSQL Configuration:**

| Aspect | Current State | Production Recommendation |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Connection Protocol** | No TLS encryption | Enable PostgreSQL SSL for production |
| **Password Strength** | Default password (`postgres`) | Use strong, unique passwords |
| **Network Exposure** | Port 5555 exposed on host | Use internal Docker network only |
| **Encryption at Rest** | Not configured | Enable disk-level encryption |
| **Connection String** | Plaintext in environment | Use secrets management system |

**Development Setup:**
```
postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/tasktracker
```

### TLS/HTTPS Configuration

**Development Mode:**
- HTTP only (port 80)
- No HTTPS (simplified for local development)
- Security headers configured but HSTS disabled

**Production Template:**
- HTTPS block provided in nginx.conf (currently commented out)
- TLS 1.2+ configured with strong ciphers
- HSTS header ready for production
- Requires SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt recommended)

!!! danger "Critical for Production"
    HTTPS must be enabled for production deployments. HTTP transmits all data in plaintext, exposing credentials and user messages to network eavesdropping.

### Secrets Management

**Current Approach:**
- Secrets stored in `.env` file (git-ignored)
- Passed to containers via Docker Compose `env_file`
- No automated secrets management system

**Sensitive Variables:**
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` - Bot authentication
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` - API key encryption
- `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - Settings encryption
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - Database authentication

**Gaps:**
- ❌ No key rotation mechanism
- ❌ No secrets management system (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- ❌ Single encryption key for all API keys
- ✅ Secrets not committed to git

---

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation ✅

**Pydantic Models** enforce strict validation on all inputs:

| Validation Method | Coverage | Examples |
|-------------------|----------|----------|
| **Type Hints** | All endpoints | Fastapi automatic validation from type hints |
| **Custom Validators** | Specific fields | Phone number format, email validation |
| **Query Constraints** | API parameters | `limit` 1-1000, `skip` >= 0 |
| **String Constraints** | Text fields | Min/max length, regex patterns |

**Result:** SQL injection and malformed input attacks are prevented through parameterized queries and type safety.

### XSS Protection ✅

**HTTP Security Headers:**

| Header | Configuration | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **CSP** | Restricts script sources, allows unsafe-inline for dev | Prevents inline script injection |
| **X-Frame-Options** | SAMEORIGIN | Prevents clickjacking attacks |
| **X-Content-Type-Options** | nosniff | Prevents MIME type sniffing |
| **X-XSS-Protection** | 1; mode=block | Legacy XSS filter (browsers) |
| **Referrer-Policy** | strict-origin-when-cross-origin | Limits referrer leakage |

**Production Consideration:** CSP permits `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` for Vite development mode. These should be removed in production builds.

### CORS Configuration ✅

| Aspect | Status | Configuration |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Origins** | Configurable | `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable (not wildcard) |
| **Methods** | Restricted | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS only |
| **Headers** | Specific | Content-Type, Authorization, X-Request-ID |
| **Credentials** | Allowed | `allow_credentials=true` (safe with restricted origins) |

**Security:** Origins are configurable, allowing different values for development vs. production without code changes.

### Rate Limiting ❌

**Current Status:** Not implemented

| Endpoint Type | Current Protection | Vulnerability |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Public API** | None | Susceptible to DoS attacks |
| **Webhook** | None | Could be abused with bot spam |
| **WebSocket** | None | No connection limits |

**Risk:** Malicious actors can overwhelm the system with high request volume.

### Error Handling

**Current Approach:**
- Consistent HTTP status codes (400, 404, 409, 502, 504)
- Meaningful error messages
- Generic error handling prevents crashes

**Gap:** Error messages may leak internal details (database error specifics). In production, sanitize errors to avoid information disclosure.

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Collected

The system collects and stores the following user and message data:

| Data Type | Collected | Stored Where | Retention |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Telegram Messages** | ✅ Yes | `message` table plaintext | Indefinite |
| **User Names** | ✅ Yes | `user` table plaintext | Indefinite |
| **Email Addresses** | ✅ Yes | `user` table plaintext | Indefinite |
| **Phone Numbers** | ✅ Yes | `user` table plaintext | Indefinite |
| **Message Embeddings** | ✅ Yes | `message` table (vectors) | Indefinite |
| **Telegram Profile Info** | ✅ Yes | `telegram_profile` table | Indefinite |
| **Message Timestamps** | ✅ Yes | `message` table | Indefinite |
| **Avatar URLs** | ✅ Yes | `user`, `telegram_profile` | Indefinite |

### Current Privacy Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| **No Data Retention Policy** | CRITICAL | Messages stored indefinitely with no cleanup mechanism |
| **No Encryption at Rest** | HIGH | User PII stored plaintext in database |
| **No User Consent Tracking** | HIGH | No mechanism to confirm users agree to data collection |
| **No Data Export API** | HIGH | Users cannot retrieve their data (GDPR violation) |
| **No Data Deletion API** | HIGH | Users cannot delete their data (GDPR violation) |
| **No Privacy Policy** | HIGH | Users not informed about data practices |
| **No GDPR Compliance** | CRITICAL | Missing key features for EU data protection law |

### GDPR Compliance Status

If the system serves EU users, these requirements are **not met**:

| GDPR Requirement | Status | Issue |
|------------------|--------|-------|
| **Right to Access** | ❌ Missing | No user data export API |
| **Right to Deletion** | ❌ Missing | No user-facing deletion API |
| **Right to Rectification** | ✅ Partial | Update endpoints exist but not user-facing |
| **Right to Data Portability** | ❌ Missing | No export format (JSON) |
| **Data Minimization** | ⚠️ Partial | Only necessary data collected, but no cleanup |
| **Storage Limitation** | ❌ Missing | No retention policy or automatic deletion |
| **Consent Management** | ❌ Missing | No consent tracking or opt-in mechanism |
| **Privacy by Design** | ⚠️ Partial | Some encryption, but many gaps |

!!! danger "For EU Deployments"
    If serving EU users, these GDPR gaps must be addressed before production deployment. Violations can result in significant fines.

### Privacy Best Practices

**Recommendations for deployment:**

1. **Create Privacy Policy** - Document what data is collected and how it's used
2. **Implement Data Retention** - Define message lifetime (suggest 90 days for sensitive systems)
3. **Add User Deletion** - Allow users to delete their data on-demand
4. **Encrypt Sensitive Data** - Consider encryption for names, emails, phone numbers
5. **Minimize Collection** - Only collect data necessary for system function
6. **Document Processing** - Create Data Processing Agreement (DPA) for your organization

|-----------------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Enable HTTPS in Production** | Low | HIGH | Encrypts all data in transit; required for sensitive information |
| **Implement Rate Limiting** | Medium | HIGH | Prevents DoS attacks on public endpoints and webhook |
| **Define Data Retention Policy** | Low | HIGH | Reduces privacy/GDPR risk; documents data lifecycle |
| **Add Dependency Scanning** | Low | HIGH | Detects vulnerable packages; integrates into CI/CD |

**Why Urgent:**
- HTTPS prevents credential/message interception
- Rate limiting stops simple DoS attacks
- Retention policy addresses legal compliance
- Dependency scanning catches known vulnerabilities early

#### 🟠 HIGH (Implement Before Production)

| Recommendation | Effort | Impact | Rationale |
|-----------------|--------|--------|-----------|

| **Strong Database Passwords** | Low | MEDIUM | Default password is known; easy to breach |
| **Enable PostgreSQL SSL** | Medium | MEDIUM | Encrypts database connections; required for prod |
| **Remove Port Exposure** | Low | MEDIUM | Postgres exposed on host port; should use internal network only |

**Implementation Scope:**
- Add `X-Telegram-Bot-API-Secret-Token` header verification
- Generate strong database password (20+ characters, random)
- Enable SSL on database container
- Update docker-compose to use internal networking

#### 🟡 MEDIUM (Implement in Phase 2)

| Recommendation | Effort | Impact | Rationale |
|-----------------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Tighten CSP Headers** | Low | MEDIUM | Production build: remove `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` |
