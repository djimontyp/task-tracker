## Search Topics

### Using the Search Bar

The search bar appears at the top of the Topics page. It searches both topic names and descriptions simultaneously.

**To search:**

1. Click the search input field (or press ++ctrl+k++)
2. Type your query (no "Enter" needed—results appear automatically)
3. Results update after 300ms of typing (debounced for performance)

**Search features:**

- **Case-insensitive**: "api" finds "API", "Api", and "api"
- **UTF-8/Cyrillic support**: Search in Ukrainian, Russian, or any language
- **Partial matching**: "auth" finds "Authentication", "OAuth", "Authorize"
- **Multi-word search**: "api design" finds topics containing both words

### Clear Search Results

Click the **×** button inside the search field to instantly clear your search and return to all topics.

### Search Results Counter

Below the search bar, you'll see: **"Found X topics"**

This shows how many topics match your current search query.

## Sort Topics

### Available Sort Options

Click the **Sort** dropdown to choose how topics are organized:

| Sort Option | Description | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Newest First** | Recently created topics at top | Default view, see what's new |
| **Oldest First** | Original topics first | Historical review, audit trail |
| **Name A-Z** | Alphabetical ascending | Find topics by name quickly |
| **Name Z-A** | Alphabetical descending | Reverse alphabetical order |
| **Recently Updated** | Last modified topics first | See active discussions |

### Default Sorting

By default, topics are sorted by **Newest First** (recently created). This shows your most recent topics at the top.

### How to Change Sorting

1. Click the **Sort** dropdown (next to search bar)
2. Select your preferred option
3. Topics reorder instantly (no page reload needed)

!!! tip "Combine Search + Sort"
    Search and sort work together! Try searching "design" and sorting by "Recently Updated" to find active design discussions.

## Navigate Pages

### Pagination Controls

When you have more than 24 topics, pagination controls appear at the bottom of the page.

**Controls available:**

- **Previous** button (◄) - Go to previous page
- **Page numbers** - Jump to specific page (1, 2, 3, ...)
- **Next** button (►) - Go to next page
- **Items counter** - Shows "Showing 1-24 of 156 topics"

### Smart Page Numbers

For large collections, page numbers use smart ellipsis:

```
◄ 1 ... 5 6 [7] 8 9 ... 20 ►
```

This keeps the interface clean while allowing quick navigation.

### Items Per Page

The page shows **24 topics** at a time (optimized for grid layout: 2 rows × 12 columns on desktop).

### Automatic Page Reset

When you search or change sorting, the page automatically resets to page 1. This ensures you see the most relevant results immediately.

## Common Workflows

### Find a Specific Topic

**Scenario:** You remember the topic is about "authentication" but don't remember the exact name.

**Steps:**

1. Type "auth" in the search bar
2. Results narrow to topics containing "auth"
3. Click the topic you need

**Time saved:** <2 seconds vs. 15+ seconds scrolling manually

---

### Browse All Topics Alphabetically

**Scenario:** You want to review all topics in alphabetical order.

**Steps:**

1. Clear any active search (click × button)
2. Select **Sort** → **Name A-Z**
3. Use pagination to browse page by page

---

### Find Recently Updated Topics

**Scenario:** You want to see which topics have been recently modified.

**Steps:**

1. Select **Sort** → **Recently Updated**
2. The most recently changed topics appear first
3. Use pagination to review older updates

---

### Search with Cyrillic Characters

**Scenario:** You have topics in Ukrainian and want to search them.

**Steps:**

1. Type Ukrainian/Russian text directly in search bar: "проект"
2. Results show matching Cyrillic topics
3. Search works identically to Latin characters

**Example searches:**

- "задач" → finds topics about tasks (задачі)
- "API" → finds topics mixing English/Cyrillic
- "дизайн інтерфейсу" → finds UI design topics

---

## Performance Tips

### Fast Search

Search uses **300ms debouncing**, meaning:

- Type naturally without waiting
- API calls only happen after you pause typing
- Reduces server load and improves responsiveness

### Caching

The system caches search results automatically:

- Switching between pages doesn't refetch data
- Going back to previous search is instant
- Cache updates when you create/edit topics

### Optimal Page Size

24 topics per page balances:

- **Visibility**: See enough topics without scrolling too much
- **Performance**: Load time stays under 500ms
- **Layout**: Fits perfectly in grid view (2 rows × 12 on desktop)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| ++ctrl+k++ | Focus search bar |
| ++escape++ | Clear search and blur input |
| ++enter++ | (Search updates automatically, Enter not needed) |

## Troubleshooting

### Search Not Working

**Symptom:** Typing in search bar doesn't filter topics

**Solutions:**

1. **Check for typos** - Try different spellings
2. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh with ++ctrl+shift+r++
3. **Verify network** - Open browser DevTools → Network tab
4. **Check API status** - Contact admin if API is down

---

### Pagination Not Appearing

**Symptom:** No pagination controls visible

**Reason:** You have 24 or fewer topics (pagination only appears when needed)

**Verification:** Check the counter—if it says "Showing 1-X of X topics" where X ≤ 24, pagination is disabled by design.

---

### Search Results Wrong

**Symptom:** Search shows unexpected topics

**Explanation:** Search matches both **name** and **description** fields. A topic might not have your keyword in the name but contains it in the description.

**Example:**

- Search: "oauth"
- Result: Topic "User Authentication" (description mentions OAuth2 implementation)

This is intentional to ensure comprehensive search results.

---

### Sort Order Not Changing

**Symptom:** Dropdown changes but topics stay in same order

**Solutions:**

1. **Refresh the page** - Sometimes cached data needs a reload
2. **Clear search** - Active search might override sorting
3. **Check browser console** - Look for JavaScript errors (F12)

---
