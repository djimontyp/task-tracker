## Key Concepts

!!! note "Core Architecture"
    The system implements a progressive filtering approach that transforms raw data into actionable insights.

### Four-Layer Architecture

1. **Raw Messages** - All data, no filtering
2. **Filtered Signals** - Noise removed via importance scoring
3. **Structured Atoms** - Extracted entities (problems, ideas, questions)
4. **Dashboard Insights** - Aggregated trends and statistics

### Technology Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Pydantic-AI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15 + pgvector
- **Message Queue:** NATS with JetStream
- **Task Processing:** TaskIQ (background jobs)
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript

### Implementation Status

| Phase | Status | Progress |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Phase 1: Foundation | ‚úÖ Complete | 100% |
| Phase 2: AI & Integration | üîÑ In Progress | 75% |
| Phase 3: Enterprise Readiness | ‚è≥ Planned | 0% |
