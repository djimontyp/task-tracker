# Epic: Product-Ready Task Tracker

**Status**: üîÑ In Progress
**Started**: 2025-10-27
**Target Completion**: 2025-11-24 (4 weeks)
**Current Readiness**: 6.8/10 ‚Üí Target: 9.0/10

---

## Goal

Transform Task Tracker from "architecturally sound" to **"ready to sell"** - focusing on core LLM features (Topics, Knowledge Extraction), UX consistency, and feature completeness. This is NOT about infrastructure (CI/CD, deployment) but about **product value proposition**.

**Success Metric**: User can demo the system, understand the value (50x information reduction via Topics), and see working end-to-end flows.

---

## Core Value Proposition

**"AI-powered knowledge extraction from Telegram messages organized into Topics with 4-layer noise filtering"**

Users should experience:
1. ‚úÖ Send Telegram message ‚Üí auto-scored (noise/signal)
2. ‚úÖ AI extracts knowledge ‚Üí creates Atoms
3. ‚úÖ Atoms organized into Topics (contextual spaces)
4. ‚úÖ Dashboard shows 50x reduced information (only signals)
5. ‚úÖ Semantic search finds related knowledge
6. ‚úÖ Analysis system proposes actionable tasks

**Current Reality**: pgvector broken (0 embeddings), UX inconsistent, 214 failing tests, no specs

---

## Scope - Product-Focused Features

### Feature 1: Core LLM Infrastructure (BLOCKER)
**Priority**: P0 üî¥ - Without this, product doesn't work
**Effort**: 6-8 hours
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

**Why**: pgvector is 100% broken (D- score), knowledge extraction non-functional
- 0 embeddings generated (all NULL in database)
- 0 vector indexes (sequential scan = 500ms+ queries)
- Semantic search returns random results
- Topic similarity matching impossible

**Deliverables**:
- Working pgvector indexes (HNSW)
- Auto-embedding generation pipeline active
- Query latency <50ms
- Semantic search returns relevant results

---

### Feature 2: UX/Accessibility Fixes (CRITICAL)
**Priority**: P0 üî¥ - Legal compliance, excludes 15-40% users
**Effort**: 13 hours
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

**Why**: WCAG violations (60% vs 95% needed), mobile unusable, poor UX
- Color contrast 3.2:1 (need 4.5:1) - accessibility violation
- Touch targets 36x36px (need 44x44px) - mobile unusable
- DataTable doesn't work on mobile
- Keyboard navigation broken (Recent Messages)
- 20+ missing ARIA labels

**Deliverables**:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (95%+)
- Mobile-responsive DataTable
- Keyboard navigation works
- Accessible forms & modals

---

### Feature 3: End-to-End Feature Consistency
**Priority**: P0 üî¥ - Core flows broken/incomplete
**Effort**: 20-25 hours
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

**Why**: 87% features lack specs, flows inconsistent, unclear behavior
- Knowledge extraction flow unclear (when triggered? batching?)
- Topic versioning rules ambiguous (draft ‚Üí approved?)
- Analysis system logic scattered (no single source of truth)
- Message scoring inconsistent (what's "noise" threshold?)

**Deliverables**:
- Documented & tested flows:
  - Telegram message ‚Üí scoring ‚Üí extraction ‚Üí Topic creation
  - Topic versioning (draft/approved lifecycle)
  - Analysis run triggers & proposal generation
- Working demo scenario (end-to-end)
- Consistent UX across all features

---

### Feature 4: Test Reliability & Type Safety
**Priority**: P1 üü° - Quality foundation
**Effort**: 10-12 hours
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

**Why**: 214 failing tests, 52 TypeScript errors, 55% coverage
- Cannot confidently release changes
- Runtime errors in production
- Poor developer experience

**Deliverables**:
- 0 failing tests (939 total pass)
- 0 TypeScript errors
- 75%+ test coverage
- Integration test suite for core flows

---

### Feature 5: Resilience & Data Safety
**Priority**: P1 üü° - Data loss prevention
**Effort**: 6-8 hours
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

**Why**: NATS message loss risk (3.5/10 resilience score)
- No JetStream persistence enabled
- No webhook retry logic
- Connection pool exhaustion risk
- Failed tasks silently drop

**Deliverables**:
- NATS JetStream persistence active
- Webhook retry with exponential backoff
- PostgreSQL connection pool tuning
- Circuit breakers for external APIs

---

### Feature 6: Authentication & Security (LONG-TERM)
**Priority**: P2 üü¢ - Required for production, not for demo
**Effort**: 20-40 hours
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending (Phase 2)

**Why**: Zero auth layer, cannot sell without security
- All data exposed (no user isolation)
- No API authentication
- Security vulnerability

**Deliverables**:
- User authentication (JWT or OAuth2)
- API route protection
- Data isolation per user
- Role-based access control

**Note**: Deprioritized for MVP demo - can demo locally without auth

## Dependencies

### External
- OpenAI/Anthropic API (for embeddings & LLM)
  - Cost: $0.40-3/month for 200 messages/day
  - Already configured in .env

### Internal Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension (‚úÖ already installed)
- NATS JetStream (‚úÖ already configured, needs persistence enabled)
- React 18 + TypeScript 5.9 (‚úÖ already set up)
- Pydantic AI agents (‚úÖ already implemented)

### Cross-Feature Dependencies
1. **Feature 1 (pgvector)** ‚Üí **Feature 3 (consistency)**: Need working embeddings to test knowledge extraction flow
2. **Feature 2 (UX)** ‚Üí **Feature 3 (consistency)**: Consistent UX requires accessible components
3. **Feature 4 (tests)** ‚Üí **Feature 3 (consistency)**: Tests validate that flows work consistently
4. **Feature 5 (resilience)** ‚Üí **Feature 3 (consistency)**: Reliable message processing required for demo

**Recommended Order**: Feature 1 ‚Üí Feature 2 ‚Üí Feature 3 ‚Üí Feature 4 ‚Üí Feature 5 ‚Üí Feature 6

## Out of Scope (Deferred to Post-Launch)

These are important for production infrastructure but **NOT blockers for product demo**:

- ‚ùå CI/CD pipeline (manual deployment acceptable for demo)
- ‚ùå Monitoring/observability (Loguru logs sufficient)
- ‚ùå Performance optimization (current 1.8GB RAM acceptable)
- ‚ùå Horizontal scaling (200-300 msg/day comfortable)
- ‚ùå Backup automation (manual backups acceptable)
- ‚ùå Documentation polish (technical docs exist, user docs minimal)

**Rationale**: Focus on **product value** (working features, good UX) over **operations** (CI/CD, monitoring). Infrastructure comes after proving product-market fit.

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: pgvector Fix Takes Longer Than Expected
**Mitigation**:
- Detailed audit already done (vector-search-report.md)
- Clear fix path: create HNSW indexes + trigger embedding generation
- Fallback: Demo with pre-seeded embeddings if real-time generation fails

### Risk 2: Feature Consistency Uncovers More Issues
**Mitigation**:
- Iterative approach: Fix one flow at a time
- Document each flow as we go
- Prioritize core flow (Telegram ‚Üí Topic) over edge cases

### Risk 3: TypeScript/Test Fixes Reveal Deeper Problems
**Mitigation**:
- Fix tests incrementally (by feature, not all at once)
- TypeScript strict mode already enabled (issues known)
- 52 errors already catalogued in react-architect-report.md

## Notes

- This epic focuses on **product readiness**, not infrastructure readiness
- User can demo after Week 2 (55-66h effort)
- Authentication (Week 4) is optional for local demo
- All audit findings preserved in `.v01-production/` for reference
- Epic artifacts tracked in `.artifacts/product-ready-epic/`
