# Navigation & Information Architecture Fixes

**Session Date**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: Feature 2 - UX/Accessibility
**Sprint**: Sprint 1 - Critical Fixes
**Duration**: 5 hours (estimated)

## Overview

Fixed critical navigation and information architecture issues in the React Dashboard to improve user experience and consistency.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Duplicate "Dashboard" Navigation Item ✅
**Problem**: Navigation had "Dashboard" label appearing twice:
- Main navigation: "Overview" at path `/`
- Automation section: "Dashboard" at path `/automation/dashboard`

**Solution**:
- Renamed main navigation "Overview" → "Dashboard"
- Renamed automation "Dashboard" → "Overview"
- Updated breadcrumbs to match new labels

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/shared/components/AppSidebar.tsx`
- `frontend/src/shared/layouts/MainLayout/Header.tsx`

### 2. Inconsistent Breadcrumb Hierarchy ✅
**Problem**: Breadcrumbs had redundant parent links that didn't match actual navigation structure.

**Solution**:
- Simplified breadcrumb hierarchy to 2 levels: Home > Current Page
- Removed unnecessary intermediate "section" links
- Applied pattern consistently across all pages

**Before**:
```
Home > Data Management > Messages
Home > AI Operations > Analysis Runs
```

**After**:
```
Home > Messages
Home > Analysis Runs
```

**Exception**: Automation section uses 3 levels for nested structure:
```
Home > Automation > Overview
Home > Automation > Rules
```

### 3. Sidebar Active State & Parent Auto-Expansion ✅
**Problem**: Automation section was flat list without collapse/expand capability.

**Solution**:
- Implemented Collapsible component for Automation section
- Added auto-expand logic when user navigates to any automation page
- Parent section remains expanded while on automation routes
- Added visual chevron indicator (rotates 90° when expanded)

**Technical Details**:
- Used Radix UI Collapsible primitive
- State management with React useState
- Auto-expand triggered by `location.pathname.startsWith('/automation')`

### 4. Tooltips for Notification Badges ✅
**Status**: Already implemented

**Analysis**:
- Analysis Runs badge: "X unclosed analysis run(s)"
- Proposals badge: "X proposal(s) awaiting review"
- Versions badge: "X version(s) awaiting approval (Y topics, Z atoms)"

All badges already had descriptive tooltips. No changes needed.

## Technical Implementation

### Components Modified

**AppSidebar.tsx**:
- Added Collapsible, CollapsibleContent, CollapsibleTrigger imports
- Added useState for automation section open/close state
- Added useEffect for auto-expand on route change
- Implemented conditional rendering for Automation group
- Added ChevronRightIcon with rotation animation

**Header.tsx**:
- Updated breadcrumbMap for all routes
- Simplified hierarchy from 3 levels to 2 for most pages
- Maintained 3-level hierarchy only for nested sections (Automation)

### New Dependencies
- `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` (added via shadcn CLI)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Zero duplicate navigation items
- [x] Breadcrumbs show correct hierarchy on all pages
- [x] Active sidebar item visually highlighted (already working)
- [x] Parent navigation items auto-expand when child is active
- [x] All badge counts have descriptive tooltips (already implemented)
- [x] Type checking passes (npx tsc --noEmit)
- [x] Mobile sidebar compatibility maintained

## Testing Checklist

### Navigation Labels
- [ ] Main Dashboard shows "Dashboard" label
- [ ] Automation section shows "Overview" label
- [ ] No duplicate "Dashboard" in sidebar

### Breadcrumbs
- [ ] All pages show simplified 2-level breadcrumbs
- [ ] Automation pages show 3-level breadcrumbs
- [ ] Breadcrumb labels match sidebar labels

### Collapsible Section
- [ ] Automation section collapses/expands on click
- [ ] Automation section auto-expands when navigating to /automation/*
- [ ] Chevron icon rotates when opening/closing
- [ ] Active item highlights within collapsed section

### Tooltips
- [ ] Analysis badge shows "X unclosed analysis run(s)"
- [ ] Proposals badge shows "X proposal(s) awaiting review"
- [ ] Versions badge shows detailed counts

### Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Sidebar works on 375px width
- [ ] Collapsible section works on mobile
- [ ] Touch interactions smooth

## Files Changed

1. `frontend/src/shared/components/AppSidebar.tsx` (major refactor)
2. `frontend/src/shared/layouts/MainLayout/Header.tsx` (breadcrumb updates)
3. `frontend/src/shared/ui/collapsible.tsx` (new component via shadcn)

## Validation Results

### Type Checking
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
# ✅ No errors
```

### Build Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No runtime errors detected
- ✅ All imports resolved

## Next Steps

1. Manual testing in browser (desktop + mobile)
2. Verify WebSocket updates still work with new structure
3. Test collapsible state persistence (if needed)
4. Update E2E tests if they reference old navigation structure

## Notes

- Active state highlighting was already working correctly
- Badge tooltips were already implemented
- Focus was primarily on fixing duplication and adding collapsible navigation
- Breadcrumb simplification improves cognitive load
