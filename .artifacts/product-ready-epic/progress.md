## Weekly Milestones

### Week 1: Core LLM + UX Foundations (19-21h)
**Goal**: Make product demonstrable
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
- [ ] Feature 1: pgvector infrastructure (6-8h)
- [ ] Feature 2: UX/Accessibility critical fixes (13h)
- **Target Outcome**: Can demo knowledge extraction + Topics working end-to-end

### Week 2: Feature Consistency + Testing (30-37h)
**Goal**: All flows work reliably
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
- [ ] Feature 3: End-to-end feature consistency (20-25h)
- [ ] Feature 4: Test reliability & TypeScript (10-12h)
- **Target Outcome**: 0 failing tests, documented flows, consistent UX

### Week 3: Resilience + Polish (6-8h)
**Goal**: Production-ready quality
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
- [ ] Feature 5: Resilience & data safety (6-8h)
- [ ] Code quality polish
- **Target Outcome**: No data loss risk, clean codebase

### Week 4: Auth + Final Integration (20-40h, OPTIONAL)
**Goal**: Security layer
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
- [ ] Feature 6: Authentication system (20-40h)
- [ ] Final integration testing
- **Target Outcome**: Ready for multi-user production

---

## Current Sprint (Week 1, Day 1)

**Focus**: Initialize epic structure + plan first feature
**Today's Goals**:
- [x] Research audit findings structure
- [x] Create epic.md roadmap
- [x] Create progress.md tracking
- [ ] Plan Feature 1 execution (pgvector fix)

---

## Blockers

**Current**: None

**Potential Risks**:
- pgvector fix may uncover deeper issues (mitigation: detailed audit already done)
- Feature consistency may reveal more broken flows (mitigation: iterative, one flow at a time)
- TypeScript fixes may reveal runtime bugs (mitigation: 52 errors already catalogued)

---

## Success Metrics Tracking

**Product Demo Readiness** (Target: Week 2 end)
- [ ] Telegram message → auto-scoring works
- [ ] AI extracts knowledge → creates Atom
- [ ] Atom organized into Topic (semantic similarity)
- [ ] Dashboard shows Topics hierarchy
- [ ] Semantic search finds related Atoms/Topics
- [ ] Analysis system proposes tasks
- [ ] UX works on mobile + desktop
- [ ] 0 failing tests
- [ ] 0 TypeScript errors
- [ ] Documented flows

**Production Launch Readiness** (Target: Week 4 end, OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Authentication & user isolation
- [ ] API security
- [ ] Multi-user deployment ready

## Feature Dependencies Graph

```
Feature 1 (pgvector)
    ↓
Feature 3 (consistency) ← Feature 2 (UX)
    ↓                         ↓
Feature 4 (tests) → Feature 5 (resilience)
                        ↓
                Feature 6 (auth, optional)
```

**Critical Path**: Feature 1 → Feature 3 → Feature 4 → Feature 5
**Parallel Work**: Feature 2 can start independently

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Plan Feature 1 (pgvector infrastructure)
   - Create tasks.md for Feature 1
   - Delegate to parallel-coordinator (Level 2)
   - Expected duration: 6-8 hours

2. **After Feature 1**: Start Feature 2 (UX/Accessibility)
   - Can work in parallel with Feature 3 planning
   - Expected duration: 13 hours

3. **Week 1 Target**: Complete Features 1-2 (19-21h total)

---

## Notes

- Epic focused on **product readiness** (working features, good UX)
- Infrastructure (CI/CD, monitoring) deferred to post-launch
- Demo-ready after Week 2 (without auth)
- Production-ready after Week 4 (with auth)
- All audit findings preserved in `.v01-production/` for reference
