KEY FINDINGS
============

CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)
- Type scale mismatch: Tailwind defaults don't match Design System spec (12,14,16,18,20,24,30px vs 12,13,14,16,18,20,24px)
- Button touch targets: Default 36px (h-9) below WCAG 44px minimum
- Hardcoded line heights: Components use custom leading-[*] instead of tokens

MEDIUM ISSUES (Should Fix)
- Card title not responsive: Fixed 14px instead of 14→16px scaling
- Form labels inconsistent: Should enforce text-sm font-medium style
- Token underutilization: 70% of components use raw Tailwind instead of design tokens

LOW ISSUES (Nice to Fix)
- Badge padding: py-0.5 should be py-1 for better balance
- Modal/Dialog spacing: No enforced spacing variants

COMPLIANCE METRICS
==================
Type Scale Implementation: 70% (font weights good, sizing off)
Spacing (4px Grid): 85% (mostly compliant, some edge cases)
Component Consistency: 65% (mixing approaches - tokens vs raw Tailwind)
Accessibility: 90% (WCAG AA met, minor improvements possible)
Overall: 70% (good foundation, critical gaps to fix)

ACTION PLAN
===========

PHASE 1 (Critical) - 1-2 Days
□ Update tailwind.config.js fontSize scale to match spec (xs=12, sm=13, base=14...)
□ Change Button default height from h-9 to h-11 (36px → 44px)
□ Remove hardcoded line heights from TopicCard, MessageCard, etc.

PHASE 2 (Medium) - 2-3 Days
□ Add responsive scaling to card titles (text-base sm:text-lg)
□ Create FormLabel component enforcing text-sm font-medium
□ Document spacing variants for Card and Dialog components

PHASE 3 (Enhancement) - 3-5 Days
□ Increase design token adoption (target 70% → 90% usage)
□ Create composition patterns using tokens
□ Improve body line-height from 1.43× to 1.5× for WCAG compliance

COMPONENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED
============================
Button: h-9 (36px) → h-11 (44px) needed
Badge: py-0.5 → py-1 for better padding
Card Title: text-base → text-base sm:text-lg for responsive hierarchy
Form Labels: Inconsistent sizing, need component enforcement
Dialog/Sheet: No spacing variant defaults

RECOMMENDATIONS
================
1. Typography should scale responsively with screen size
2. All spacing decisions should go through 4px grid lens
3. Encourage composition pattern usage over raw Tailwind
4. Regular token adoption audits quarterly
5. Pre-commit checks for hardcoded sizes (leading-*, px-, etc)

CODE REFERENCES
===============
Design System Docs:
  - docs/design-system/02-typography.md (type scale definition)
  - docs/design-system/03-spacing.md (4px grid spec)
  - docs/design-system/00-philosophy.md (design principles)

Implementation:
  - frontend/tailwind.config.js (current config, needs fontSize update)
  - frontend/src/shared/tokens/spacing.ts (well-defined tokens)
  - frontend/src/shared/ui/button.tsx (touch target issue)
  - frontend/src/shared/ui/card.tsx (padding OK)

Components Analyzed:
  - TopicCard: hardcoded line heights
  - MessageCard: inconsistent scaling
  - AtomCard: font sizing issues
  - PageHeader: responsive OK
  - Button: size issue
  - Badge: padding issue

NEXT STEPS
==========
1. Review and approve findings with team
2. Prioritize Phase 1 fixes for immediate implementation
3. Plan Phase 2 component refactoring
4. Schedule Phase 3 enhancement work
5. Implement quarterly compliance checks

RESOURCES
=========
Main Report: .artifacts/design-system-audit/03-typography-spacing.md
Screenshots: .artifacts/screenshots/audit/
