## Detailed Reports

### mobile-types Report

**Source:** `/Users/maks/PycharmProjects/task-tracker/.artifacts/task-form-redesign/20251023_005554/agent-reports/mobile-types-report.md`

# Summary

Successfully implemented mobile-first responsive layout for SchemaEditor component and validated TypeScript type definitions. The implementation ensures optimal user experience across all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) while maintaining type safety and accessibility standards.

The mobile-responsive design transforms the desktop grid layout into a vertical stack on small screens, with full-width fields and appropriately sized touch targets (minimum 44x44px). Column headers are hidden on mobile to save space, and labels are shown inline for each field.

**Key Achievements:**
- Mobile-first responsive layout with Tailwind CSS breakpoints (md:768px)
- TypeScript type definitions consolidated and exported for reuse
- Accessibility enhanced with proper ARIA attributes and touch targets
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- Build successful in 3.27s

### schema-editor Report

**Source:** `/Users/maks/PycharmProjects/task-tracker/.artifacts/task-form-redesign/20251023_005554/agent-reports/schema-editor-report.md`

# Summary

Successfully refactored `SchemaEditor.tsx` to simplify the UI based on UX audit recommendations. The component now features a cleaner, flatter design with improved usability and accessibility.

The refactoring removed unnecessary visual clutter (nested Cards, JSON preview), reorganized the layout with proper column headers, and enhanced keyboard navigation with auto-focus on newly added fields.

**Key Achievements:**
- Removed JSON Preview section completely (-12 lines)
- Flattened Card nesting structure for cleaner UI
- Added column headers for better field organization
- Updated grid proportions from 4-3-4-1 to 4-2-5-1
- Implemented auto-focus for new fields (UX improvement)
- Enhanced accessibility with dynamic aria-labels

### taskform-labels Report

**Source:** `/Users/maks/PycharmProjects/task-tracker/.artifacts/task-form-redesign/20251023_005554/agent-reports/taskform-labels-report.md`

# Summary

Successfully updated `TaskForm.tsx` to reflect new terminology, replacing "Response Schema" with "Response Fields" across the UI. Added accessibility improvements through proper fieldset/legend structure and implemented contextual help via tooltip component.

The integration with the refactored SchemaEditor component (by Agent 1) was verified and works seamlessly - no interface changes were required, ensuring backward compatibility.

**Key Achievements:**
- Updated terminology from "Response Schema" to "Response Fields"
- Added tooltip with contextual help for better UX
- Implemented proper accessibility structure with fieldset/legend
- Verified TypeScript compilation (build successful)
- Maintained full integration with refactored SchemaEditor
