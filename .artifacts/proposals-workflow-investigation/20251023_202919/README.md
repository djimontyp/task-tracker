# Proposals Workflow Investigation

**Investigation Date:** 2025-10-23
**Session ID:** 20251023_202919
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## Overview

Comprehensive investigation of the frontend implementation of proposal workflows in the Task Tracker project.

**Scope:** Frontend components, user workflows, state management, WebSocket integration, and integration points.

**Key Finding:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Only **Task Proposals** are implemented. Topic/Atom proposals do not exist in the system.

## What's Inside

### Component Analysis
- **ProposalsPage** - Main container with filtering and list view
- **ProposalCard** - Individual proposal display with expandable details
- **RejectProposalDialog** - Rejection workflow with required reason
- **proposalService** - API service layer with TanStack Query integration

### User Workflows Documented
1. View Proposals (filtering, search)
2. Approve Proposal (single-click approval)
3. Reject Proposal (modal with required reason)
4. Edit Proposal (‚ö†Ô∏è not implemented)
5. Merge Proposal (‚ö†Ô∏è not implemented)

### Technical Details
- State management patterns (TanStack Query)
- WebSocket integration (real-time updates)
- API endpoints catalog
- Type system analysis
- Performance observations
- Code quality assessment

---

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- Task Proposals full CRUD
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Advanced filtering (status, confidence, search)
- Card-based responsive UI
- Integration with Analysis Runs, Dashboard, Sidebar

### ‚ùå Missing
- Topic/Atom proposals (do not exist)
- Edit proposal workflow
- Merge proposals workflow
- Bulk operations
- Pagination
- Detail pages
- History/audit trail
- Export/reporting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues
- No pagination (fetches all proposals)
- Client-side filtering after backend fetch
- No direct WebSocket on ProposalsPage
- Limited accessibility
- No tests

---

## Top Recommendations

1. **Implement Pagination** (HIGH) - Performance bottleneck
2. **Add Edit Workflow** (HIGH) - Callback exists, UI missing
3. **Bulk Operations** (MEDIUM) - Approve/reject multiple
4. **Direct WebSocket** (MEDIUM) - Granular updates
5. **Merge Workflow** (LOW) - API exists, UI missing

---

## Quick Stats

**Code Analyzed:**
- 12 files reviewed
- 4 main components
- ~1,500+ lines of code
- 6 API endpoints
- 4 WebSocket events

**Report Size:**
- 14,500+ words
- 20+ sections

## Investigation Methodology

### Approach
1. ‚úÖ Code structure analysis (feature-based architecture)
2. ‚úÖ Component inventory (props, state, behavior)
3. ‚úÖ User workflow mapping (interaction flows)
4. ‚úÖ API integration review (service layer, endpoints)
5. ‚úÖ WebSocket integration analysis (real-time updates)
6. ‚úÖ State management patterns (TanStack Query)
7. ‚úÖ Type system validation (TypeScript interfaces)
8. ‚úÖ Integration points discovery (cross-feature connections)
9. ‚úÖ Limitations identification (gaps, missing features)
10. ‚úÖ Recommendations formulation (prioritized action items)

### Tools Used
- ‚úÖ Static code analysis (Read, Grep, Glob)
- ‚úÖ Backend correlation (model/API verification)
- ‚úÖ Architecture pattern recognition
- ‚úÖ Type system analysis
- ‚úÖ Documentation extraction

## Critical Insight

### Only Task Proposals Exist

After thorough investigation of both frontend and backend:

**Confirmed Existence:**
- ‚úÖ `TaskProposal` model (`backend/app/models/task_proposal.py`)
- ‚úÖ Task proposals API (`/api/v1/analysis/proposals`)
- ‚úÖ Task proposals frontend (`features/proposals/`)

**Confirmed Non-Existence:**
- ‚ùå `TopicProposal` model - NOT FOUND
- ‚ùå `AtomProposal` model - NOT FOUND
- ‚ùå Topic/Atom proposal APIs - NOT FOUND
- ‚ùå Topic/Atom proposal UI - NOT FOUND

**Implication:** If Topic/Atom proposals are needed, this would be a new feature requiring:
1. Backend models (TopicProposal, AtomProposal)
2. Backend API endpoints
3. Frontend components (reusable patterns from TaskProposal)
4. WebSocket events
5. UI/UX design
