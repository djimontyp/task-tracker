2. No `approved_by` field (missing audit trail)
3. No direct rollback mechanism (workaround: approve older version)

**Priority:** P2 (security improvement, not blocking)

## Next Feature

Feature 5: Operational Documentation
- Operational runbooks
- Configuration management
- Performance benchmarks
- Security and privacy
- **Estimate:** 12-20 hours

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
✅ Parallel investigation phase (4 batches) found all critical info
✅ Parallel documentation batch (4 agents) efficient for independent files
✅ Single translation agent (1 batch) maintained consistency
✅ State machine investigation resolved audit discrepancy correctly
✅ Terminology standardization from Phase 2 prevented translation inconsistencies

### What Could Improve
⚠️ Agent system endpoint count: Investigation found 17+, documentation used 23 (slight overcount)
→ Solution: Always verify endpoint counts in validation phase

### Coordination Success
✅ No merge conflicts (different files in parallel)
✅ No duplicate research (investigation reports shared)
✅ Clean check-ins between batches
✅ Format compliance maintained throughout

## Time Performance

| Phase | Estimated | Actual | Variance |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Phase 1: Research | 120 min | 30 min | -75% |
| Phase 2: Documentation | 180 min | 40 min | -78% |
| Phase 3: Translation | 120 min | 60 min | -50% |
| Phase 4: Validation | 30 min | 30 min | 0% |
| **Total** | **450 min** | **160 min** | **-64%** |

**Efficiency:** 2.8x faster than estimated (290 minutes saved)

**Why Faster:**
- Complete investigation reports available
- Clear format requirements
- Parallel batch execution
- Experienced agents (documentation-expert, fastapi-backend-expert)
- No user clarifications needed
- Terminology pre-standardized

**Actual Time:** ~2.7 hours (vs 7.5 hours estimated)
