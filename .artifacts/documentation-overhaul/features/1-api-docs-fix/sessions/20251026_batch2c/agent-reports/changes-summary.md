## Change 2: Cross-Reference in topic_created Event

**Location**: Lines 283-284 (after event field table)

**Added**:

**Added**:
```markdown
!!! info "Related Operations"
    Use the **Atoms Management API** to further refine atoms: update titles/content,
    change types, approve/reject auto-classifications, or link atoms together.
    See [Atoms Management](#atoms-management) for available endpoints.
```

**Purpose**: Guides users from the event notification to the management API.

## Key Statistics

### CRUD Operations Documented
- **Topics API**: 8 operations (GET ×3, POST ×1, PATCH ×1, + 3 specialized)
- **Atoms API**: 6 operations (GET ×2, POST ×2, PATCH ×1, DELETE ×1)
- **Versions API**: 8 operations (GET ×2, POST ×4, GET diff ×2)
- **Total**: 22 CRUD operations cross-referenced

### Format Consistency
- ✅ 3 operation tables (hybrid format)
- ✅ 1 introductory section
- ✅ 5 inline cross-reference notes
- ✅ 3 tip/warning admonitions
- ✅ All markdown anchor links working

### Quality Metrics
- ✅ 0 provider_id references
- ✅ 0 422 error codes
- ✅ 13 agent_config_id references verified
- ✅ 6 WebSocket events documented
- ✅ 6 /ws endpoint references correct
- ✅ 100% terminology consistency

## Translation Impact

### No New Terminology Introduced
All terms used in new sections already exist in Batch 2A/2B:
- Topic management, Atoms, Versions (already defined)
- GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE (HTTP verbs - same in all languages)
- API endpoints (don't translate)

### No Format Changes
- Same table structure as rest of document
- Same admonition style (tip, info, warning)
- Same anchor link pattern
- Same code styling

### Translation Effort Estimate
The Ukrainian translator can efficiently translate Batch 2C because:
1. No new technical concepts introduced
2. Straightforward table translations
3. Reusable terminology from previous batches
4. Consistent format throughout

## Verification Commands

To verify changes:

```bash
# Check file line count
wc -l docs/content/en/api/knowledge.md

# Verify no provider_id references
grep provider_id docs/content/en/api/knowledge.md

# Verify agent_config_id references (should be ~13)
grep -c agent_config_id docs/content/en/api/knowledge.md

# Verify no 422 errors
grep "422" docs/content/en/api/knowledge.md

# Verify Related API Operations section exists
grep -n "Related API Operations" docs/content/en/api/knowledge.md
```
