# Batch 2B Summary: WebSocket Endpoint Structure Fix

**Batch ID:** 2B
**Feature:** API Documentation Fix (Feature 1 of Epic Documentation Overhaul)
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Overview

Fixed WebSocket endpoint documentation to reflect actual backend implementation. Updated the "Connection" section in Knowledge Extraction API documentation to document the correct `/ws` endpoint with topic-based subscription mechanism instead of the previously documented dedicated `/ws/knowledge` endpoint.

---

## Files Modified

### Primary Changes

| File | Lines Changed | Change Type |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| `docs/content/en/api/knowledge.md` | 182-237 (56 lines) | Major restructure + addition |

**Total file lines:** 735 (expanded from ~229 original connection section)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed WebSocket Endpoint URL

**Before:**
```
**URL:** `ws://localhost:8000/ws/knowledge`
```

**After:**
```
**Endpoint:** `ws://localhost:8000/ws`
```

**Rationale:** Backend uses generic `/ws` endpoint with topic subscriptions, not dedicated topic-specific endpoints.

---

### 2. Added Connection Steps (Numbered List)

Replaced code-only examples with clear procedural steps:

1. Connect to the `/ws` endpoint
2. Upon connection, send a subscription message
3. Server responds with confirmation containing subscribed topics
4. Listen for events on the `knowledge` topic

**Benefit:** Users understand the workflow before diving into code examples.

---

### 3. Documented Subscription Mechanism

Added new **Subscription Message Format** section:

```json
{
  "action": "subscribe",
  "topic": "knowledge"
}
```

This clarifies that clients must explicitly subscribe after connecting (not automatic).

---

### 4. Added Topic Routing Table

Created comprehensive topic reference:

| Topic | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `knowledge` | Knowledge extraction events (topics, atoms, versions) |
| `agents` | Agent configuration lifecycle events |
| `tasks` | Task processing events |
| `providers` | LLM provider status events |
| `analysis` | Analysis system events |
| `proposals` | Proposal generation events |

**Benefit:** Users see all available topics and understand what each topic covers.

---

### 5. Documented Multi-Topic Subscriptions

Explained both message and query parameter approaches:

**Message-based (dynamic):**
```json
{"action": "subscribe", "topic": "knowledge"}
{"action": "subscribe", "topic": "analysis"}
```

**Query parameter (on connect):**
```
ws://localhost:8000/ws?topics=knowledge,analysis
```

**Benefit:** Users understand both connection patterns supported by the backend.

---

### 6. Added Connection Lifecycle

New structured section explaining complete connection flow:

1. **Connection Established** - Server sends confirmation with subscribed topics
2. **Subscription Active** - Server broadcasts matching events to your connection
3. **Dynamic Updates** - Send additional `subscribe`/`unsubscribe` messages anytime
4. **Disconnection** - Client closes connection or server times out

## WebSocket References Audit

### Updated References
- ✅ Line 188: Endpoint URL corrected from `/ws/knowledge` to `/ws`
- ✅ Removed old code examples that showed `/ws/knowledge` pattern

### Verified Correct References
- ✅ Line 550: Integration example correctly uses `ws://localhost:8000/ws`
- ✅ Line 642: Python example correctly uses `/ws` with subscription message
- ✅ All integration examples (lines 515-698) already use correct pattern

### No Incorrect References Found
- ✅ No remaining `/ws/knowledge` endpoints in documentation
- ✅ No conflicting endpoint patterns

---

## Consistency with Backend

### Verified Against Implementation

**Backend router** (`app/ws/router.py`):
- Endpoint: `@router.websocket("/ws")` ✅
- Subscription pattern: `{"action": "subscribe", "topic": "knowledge"}` ✅
- Query parameter: `topics: str | None = None` ✅
- Default topics: `["agents", "tasks", "providers", "messages", "analysis", "proposals"]` ✅

**Documentation now reflects:**
- Generic `/ws` endpoint with query parameter support
- Topic-based subscription system
- Multiple simultaneous topic subscriptions
- Full list of available topics

---

## Documentation Quality

### Format Applied
- ✅ Hybrid approach: numbered list (steps) + table (topics) + JSON examples (formats)
- ✅ Clear procedural flow without code examples in steps section
- ✅ Connection lifecycle diagram in text form
- ✅ Consistent with MkDocs Material style

### Clarity Improvements
- ✅ Explicit subscription message format documented
- ✅ Multi-topic capability clearly explained
- ✅ Query parameter alternative provided
- ✅ Connection lifecycle stages defined
- ✅ Topic reference table for quick lookup

---

## Integration with Batch 2A

### No Conflicts with Previous Changes
- ✅ Parameter names (`agent_config_id`) already fixed in 2A - unchanged
- ✅ WebSocket event types already documented - unchanged
- ✅ Integration examples already updated with correct `/ws` pattern in 2A
- ✅ Both batches now aligned on WebSocket endpoint usage

---

## Context from Phase 1 Research

All findings from `backend-investigation.md` and `docs-analysis.md` addressed:

| Finding | Status | Location |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Endpoint wrong: `/ws/knowledge` vs actual `/ws` | ✅ Fixed | Line 188 |
| Missing subscription mechanism explanation | ✅ Added | Lines 190-237 |
| Subscription message format not documented | ✅ Added | Lines 197-203 |
| Multi-topic capability not mentioned | ✅ Added | Lines 206-230 |
| Connection lifecycle unclear | ✅ Added | Lines 232-237 |

---

## Checklist

- ✅ WebSocket endpoint URL corrected: `/ws/knowledge` → `/ws`
- ✅ Subscription mechanism documented with message format
- ✅ Topic routing system explained with reference table
- ✅ Multi-topic capability clearly documented
- ✅ Connection steps numbered and clear
- ✅ Query parameter alternative included
- ✅ No remaining incorrect `/ws/knowledge` references
- ✅ Consistent with backend implementation
- ✅ No conflicts with Batch 2A changes
- ✅ MkDocs Material best practices applied

---

## Summary

Successfully restructured WebSocket connection documentation to reflect the actual backend implementation. The generic `/ws` endpoint with topic-based subscriptions is now clearly documented with step-by-step instructions, subscription message formats, topic reference table, and connection lifecycle explanation. All documentation is now consistent with the actual backend router and previously completed integration examples.

**Key Achievement:** Users can now understand and properly implement WebSocket connections without confusion about endpoint structure or subscription mechanisms.
