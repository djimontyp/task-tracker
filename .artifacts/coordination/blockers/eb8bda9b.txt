Blocker Signal:
I'll attempt to read the specified file.
As expected, the file does not exist.

**Status:** Blocked
**Problem:** Cannot find required model file
**Need:** Correct file path for user model

The file `/Users/maks/PycharmProjects/task-tracker/backend/app/models/NONEXISTENT_FILE.py` does not exist in the repository. 

If you need to locate the actual user model or other model files, I can search for them. Let me know the correct filename or what model you're looking for, and I can help locate it in the codebase.
