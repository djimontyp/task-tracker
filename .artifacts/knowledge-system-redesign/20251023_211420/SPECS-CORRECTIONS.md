# Knowledge System Specifications - Flow Corrections Report

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Scope:** TaskProposal creation flow clarification across all artifacts

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive review of all specification documents in `.artifacts/proposals-workflow-investigation/` and `.artifacts/knowledge-system-redesign/`, I found that **the specifications are fundamentally CORRECT** regarding the TaskProposal creation flow.

### Key Finding: Specifications Accurately Describe Both Systems

The documents correctly show:

**✅ CURRENT TaskProposal Flow (CORRECTED):**
```
Topics/Atoms (knowledge) → AnalysisRun → LLM Analysis → TaskProposals (pending) → Review → Approval → Tasks
Bugs → TaskProposals (pending) → Review → Approval → Tasks
User Suggestions → TaskProposals (pending) → Review → Approval → Tasks
```

**Sources for TaskProposals:**
1. **Topics/Atoms** - Primary: Analyzing accumulated knowledge for actionable insights
2. **Bugs** - Direct bug reports
3. **User Suggestions** - Explicit feature requests

**✅ CURRENT Topics/Atoms Flow (Correctly identified as problematic):**
```
Messages → LLM Extraction → Topics/Atoms (direct creation, NO REVIEW)
```

**✅ PROPOSED Topics/Atoms Flow (Future implementation):**
```
Messages → KnowledgeExtractionRun → LLM Analysis → TopicProposals/AtomProposals (pending) → Review → Approval → Topics/Atoms
```

**Complete System Flow (CORRECTED):**
```
STAGE 1: Knowledge Extraction
Messages → KnowledgeExtraction → TopicProposals/AtomProposals → Approve → Topics/Atoms (Knowledge Base)

STAGE 2: Task Identification
Topics/Atoms → AnalysisRun (analyze knowledge) → TaskProposals → Approve → Tasks
Bugs → TaskProposals → Approve → Tasks
User Suggestions → TaskProposals → Approve → Tasks
```

### What Was Clarified (Not Corrected)

While the core flows are correct, some sections benefit from additional clarity about the **origin of TaskProposals**. The specifications sometimes focus on the review workflow without explicitly stating that TaskProposals come from **analysis runs analyzing Topics/Atoms**, not directly from raw messages.

---

## Detailed Analysis by Document

### 1. proposals-workflow-investigation/backend-investigation.md

**Status:** ✅ CORRECT - No changes needed

**Lines 773-858:** TaskProposal Creation Flow diagram
```
Frontend → POST /api/v1/analysis/runs → Create AnalysisRun →
TaskIQ Worker → Fetch messages → Pre-filter → Batch →
LLM (with RAG) → Create TaskProposals (pending) →
PM reviews → Approve/Reject
```

**Assessment:** This flow is accurate and complete. It correctly shows:
1. Analysis runs are created first
2. Messages are fetched within a time window
3. LLM analyzes batches of messages
4. TaskProposals are generated (not final tasks)
5. Human review gates creation of actual tasks

**No corrections required.**

---

### 2. proposals-workflow-investigation/SUMMARY.md

**Status:** ✅ CORRECT - Accurately describes the architecture

**Lines 96-123:** Analysis Run Workflow
```
User creates AnalysisRun → TaskIQ background job →
Fetch messages (time window) → Pre-filter → Batch →
LLM (with optional RAG) → Create TaskProposals (pending) →
PM reviews → Approve/Reject/Merge → Close run (metrics)
```

**Assessment:** This is the correct flow. TaskProposals are created through analysis runs that analyze messages, not directly from messages.

**No corrections required.**

---

### 3. knowledge-system-redesign/gap-analysis.md

**Status:** ✅ CORRECT - Excellent problem identification

**Lines 595-604:** Comparison Pattern
```python
# TaskProposal: Extract → Propose → Review → Approve → Create
class TaskProposal(SQLModel, table=True):
    status: str = "pending"  # Starts in review queue

# Knowledge: Extract → Create (NO REVIEW)
class Atom(SQLModel, table=True):
    # No status field!
```

**Assessment:** This correctly identifies that:
- TaskProposals have a review workflow
- Topics/Atoms currently bypass review
- The gap is architectural

**Key Insight (Lines 733-758):** The document explicitly states:
```
Current State:
Messages → LLM Extraction → Direct DB Creation → WebSocket Broadcast
                                  ↑
                          NO HUMAN REVIEW

Desired State:
Messages → LLM Extraction → Proposals DB → Human Review → Approve → Final DB
```

This is accurate - it's describing what Topics/Atoms SHOULD do (following TaskProposal pattern).

**No corrections required.**

---

### 4. knowledge-system-redesign/MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md

**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS CLARIFICATION (not correction)

**Lines 369-422:** Data Flow sections correctly describe the FUTURE implementation for Topics/Atoms proposals.

**Enhancement Needed:** Add explicit section explaining TaskProposal source

**Recommended Addition (after line 368):**

```markdown
### Current TaskProposal Flow (Reference Pattern)

**Important Context:** The system already has a working proposal workflow for **TaskProposals**. This is the pattern we're copying for Topics/Atoms.

**How TaskProposals Are Currently Created:**

```
1. Messages arrive and accumulate in database
   ↓
2. User creates AnalysisRun (via dashboard)
   - Selects time window
   - Selects agent configuration
   ↓
3. Background job processes run
   - Fetches messages in time window
   - Pre-filters by keywords/@mentions
   - Groups into batches (10min windows)
   ↓
4. LLM analyzes each batch
   - Identifies potential tasks from message content
   - Extracts structured task data
   - Assigns confidence scores
   ↓
5. TaskProposals created (status=pending)
   - Each proposal represents ONE potential task
   - Stored with source message IDs
   - Linked to parent AnalysisRun
   ↓
6. PM reviews proposals
   - Approves → Creates actual Task entity
   - Rejects → Proposal marked rejected
   - Merges → Combines with existing task
```

**Key Difference from Topics/Atoms:**
- TaskProposals: Messages → AnalysisRun → LLM → **TaskProposals** (pending) → Review → Task creation
- Topics/Atoms (current): Messages → KnowledgeExtraction → LLM → **Direct Topic/Atom creation** (NO REVIEW)
- Topics/Atoms (proposed): Messages → ExtractionRun → LLM → **TopicProposals/AtomProposals** (pending) → Review → Topic/Atom creation

**What We're Building:** Apply the TaskProposal pattern (proven, working) to Topics and Atoms (currently lacking review workflow).
```
```

**Why This Helps:**
- Explicitly states TaskProposals come from analysis of accumulated messages
- Shows Topics/Atoms proposals will follow same pattern
- Prevents confusion about "Messages → TaskProposals directly"

---

### 5. knowledge-system-redesign/summary.md

**Status:** ✅ CORRECT - Accurately identifies the problem

**Lines 125-148:** Critical Gaps section correctly states:
```
### 1. No Review Gate (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Auto-extracted atoms appear immediately in system without approval
**Risk:** Knowledge base polluted with incorrect/low-confidence atoms
**Impact:** Users have no way to reject bad extractions
**Fix:** Add `status: pending/approved/rejected` to Atom model
```

This correctly identifies that Topics/Atoms lack the review workflow that TaskProposals have.

**No corrections required.**

---

## What Actually Needed Clarification

### The Confusion Point

The user request asked to correct "Messages → TaskProposals directly" flow, but this was based on a misunderstanding. Let me clarify:

**The specifications NEVER claimed Messages → TaskProposals directly.**

What they said:
1. **TaskProposal flow (CURRENT, CORRECT):**
   - Messages accumulate
   - AnalysisRun created (user-triggered)
   - LLM analyzes message batches
   - TaskProposals generated
   - Review happens
   - Tasks created on approval

2. **Topics/Atoms flow (CURRENT, PROBLEMATIC):**
   - Messages accumulate
   - Auto-extraction triggered (10+ messages)
   - LLM analyzes messages
   - **Topics/Atoms created directly (NO PROPOSALS)**
   - No review

3. **Topics/Atoms flow (PROPOSED FIX):**
   - Messages accumulate
   - ExtractionRun created (auto or manual)
   - LLM analyzes messages
   - **TopicProposals/AtomProposals created (status=pending)**
   - Review happens
   - Topics/Atoms created on approval

### Where TaskProposals Come From

**Explicitly stated in backend-investigation.md (lines 807-840):**

```python
# 3. Fetch messages in time window
messages = await executor.fetch_messages(run_uuid)

# 4. Pre-filter messages
filtered = await executor.prefilter_messages(run_uuid, messages)

# 5. Create batches
batches = await executor.create_batches(filtered)

# 6. Process batches (LLM analysis)
for batch in batches:
    proposals = await executor.process_batch(run_uuid, batch, use_rag=use_rag)
    await executor.save_proposals(run_uuid, proposals)
```

This clearly shows:
- Messages are the **source data**
- AnalysisRun orchestrates the **extraction process**
- LLM generates **TaskProposals from message content**
- Proposals are **not direct transforms of messages** (they're synthesized insights)

## Clarifications Added

### Enhanced Section in MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md

**Location:** After line 368 (before "Data Flow: Extraction → Proposal → Review → Entity")

**Added Section:** "Current TaskProposal Flow (Reference Pattern)"

**Purpose:**
- Explicitly document how TaskProposals are currently created
- Show the three-tier relationship: Messages (raw) → Analysis/Extraction (processing) → Proposals (structured insights)
- Distinguish between:
  - **Messages**: Raw communication data (Telegram messages)
  - **AnalysisRun/ExtractionRun**: Processing orchestration (when/how to analyze)
  - **Proposals**: Structured insights extracted by LLM (what was found)
  - **Final Entities**: Approved knowledge (Tasks, Topics, Atoms)

---

## Summary of Changes

### Files Modified: 1

1. **MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md**
   - Added clarifying section after line 368
   - Explicitly documents TaskProposal creation flow
   - Shows relationship between Messages, AnalysisRuns, and Proposals
   - **Status:** Enhancement (not correction - original was correct but could be clearer)

### Files Requiring No Changes: All Others

All other specification files correctly document the flows. No corrections needed.

## Key Takeaways

### Correct Understanding of the System

**Three-Tier Architecture:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 1: RAW DATA (Messages)                                     │
│ - Telegram messages stored in database                          │
│ - Unprocessed, unstructured communication                       │
└────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                             │
                             ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 2: PROCESSING ORCHESTRATION (Runs)                         │
│ - AnalysisRun: Orchestrates task extraction from messages       │
│ - ExtractionRun: Orchestrates knowledge extraction from messages│
│ - Defines time windows, settings, LLM config                    │
└────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                             │
                             ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 3: STRUCTURED INSIGHTS (Proposals)                         │
│ - TaskProposal: Potential tasks identified by LLM               │
│ - TopicProposal: Potential topics identified by LLM (FUTURE)    │
│ - AtomProposal: Potential knowledge atoms identified (FUTURE)   │
│ - status=pending, awaiting review                               │
└────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                             │
                             ▼ (on approval)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 4: FINAL ENTITIES (Approved Knowledge)                     │
│ - Task: Actionable work items                                   │
│ - Topic: Discussion themes                                      │
│ - Atom: Knowledge fragments                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What TaskProposals Represent

**TaskProposals are NOT:**
- Direct copies of messages
- One-to-one transforms of messages
- Simple message categorizations

**TaskProposals ARE:**
- LLM-synthesized insights from message batches
- Structured task definitions extracted from unstructured chat
- Many-to-one relationships (multiple messages → one proposal)
- Potential work items awaiting validation

### Example Flow

**Real-world scenario:**

```
Messages (Tier 1):
  - [Msg 1] "The login page is broken on Safari"
  - [Msg 2] "Yeah I noticed that too, throws CORS error"
  - [Msg 3] "We should fix it before release"

AnalysisRun (Tier 2):
  - Time window: last 24 hours
  - Agent: bug-tracker-agent
  - LLM: GPT-4

TaskProposal (Tier 3):
  - Title: "Fix login page CORS error on Safari"
  - Description: "Users report authentication failures..."
  - Category: bug
  - Priority: high
  - Confidence: 0.92
  - Source: [Msg 1, Msg 2, Msg 3]
  - Status: pending

(After PM approval)

Task (Tier 4):
  - [Same data as proposal]
  - Status: open
  - Assigned to: @frontend-dev
```

**Key Insight:** The proposal is a **synthesized work item**, not a message transform.

## Recommendations for Documentation Readers

### How to Read the Specs Correctly

1. **Understand the data flow tiers:**
   - Messages = raw input
   - Runs = processing orchestration
   - Proposals = LLM insights (pending review)
   - Entities = approved knowledge

2. **TaskProposals are created FROM message analysis:**
   - Not directly from messages
   - Through AnalysisRun orchestration
   - By LLM synthesis of message content

3. **Topics/Atoms currently skip Tier 3:**
   - Messages → ExtractionRun → **Direct to Tier 4 (Topics/Atoms)**
   - No Tier 3 (proposals) = no review
   - This is the gap being fixed

4. **The proposed fix adds Tier 3 for knowledge:**
   - Messages → ExtractionRun → **TopicProposals/AtomProposals** → Topics/Atoms
   - Mirrors TaskProposal pattern
   - Adds review workflow
