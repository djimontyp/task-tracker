## Quick Summary

### System Status: 80% Complete
- ‚úÖ Backend implementation: 95%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend UI: 20%
- ‚úÖ Test coverage: 96%
- ‚úÖ Type safety: 100% (mypy 0 errors)

5. Background task orchestration via TaskIQ

### What's Missing
1. **Approval/Review Workflow** - No gate for auto-extracted atoms
2. **Versioning/History** - No audit trail for changes
3. **Deduplication** - Can't merge similar atoms
4. **Confidence UI** - Users can't filter by confidence
5. **Review Dashboard** - No centralized curation interface
6. **Topic Consolidation** - No mechanism to merge topics

## Critical Findings

### üî¥ CRITICAL: No Review Gate
**Issue:** Auto-extracted atoms appear immediately without approval
**Impact:** Knowledge base can be polluted with incorrect atoms
**Fix:** Add approval status (pending/approved/rejected) to Atom model

### üü° WARNING: Topic Fragmentation
**Issue:** Only exact name matching for topic reuse
**Impact:** Similar topics created separately ("API Design" vs "API Design Decisions")
**Fix:** Implement semantic similarity using embeddings

### üü° WARNING: Low-Confidence Atoms Lost
**Issue:** Atoms below 0.7 confidence silently skipped
**Impact:** Potentially valuable knowledge discarded
**Fix:** Store low-confidence atoms with pending_review status

### üü° WARNING: No Deduplication
**Issue:** No mechanism to detect/merge duplicate atoms
**Impact:** Knowledge graph becomes redundant
**Fix:** Add similarity scoring and merge UI

## Workflow: Message ‚Üí Topic/Atom

```
1. Message arrives (Telegram webhook)
   ‚îî‚îÄ save_telegram_message task
       ‚îî‚îÄ Create Message (topic_id=NULL)
       ‚îî‚îÄ queue_knowledge_extraction_if_needed()

2. Threshold check (every message)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Count unprocessed messages in last 24h
       ‚îú‚îÄ If count >= 10: Queue extraction task
       ‚îî‚îÄ If count < 10: Continue monitoring

3. Background extraction job (extract_knowledge_from_messages_task)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Fetch up to 50 unprocessed messages
   ‚îú‚îÄ Call LLM (Pydantic AI agent)
   ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Returns: Topics(1-3) + Atoms(5-10) + Relationships
   ‚îú‚îÄ Filter by confidence >= 0.7
   ‚îú‚îÄ save_topics() - Create new topics, reuse by name match
   ‚îú‚îÄ save_atoms() - Create atoms, link to topics
   ‚îú‚îÄ link_atoms() - Create AtomLink relationships
   ‚îú‚îÄ update_messages() - Set Message.topic_id
   ‚îî‚îÄ Broadcast 5 WebSocket events

4. Result
   ‚îú‚îÄ 1-3 Topics in database
   ‚îú‚îÄ 5-10 Atoms in database
   ‚îú‚îÄ Multiple AtomLinks created
   ‚îî‚îÄ 50 messages assigned to topics
```

## Recommendations (Prioritized)

### WEEK 1 - Critical Path (Do First!)
1. **Add Approval Workflow**
   - Add `status: pending/approved/rejected` to Atom
   - Add `reviewed_by_user_id`, `reviewed_at` fields
   - Create endpoints: POST /atoms/{id}/approve, /reject, /batch/approve
   - Build ReviewQueue component

2. **Confidence Filtering UI**
   - Add query parameter: GET /atoms?confidence_min=0.7
   - Build ConfidenceFilter React component
   - Filter low-confidence atoms for review

3. **Extraction History Tracking**
   - Create AtomRevision model for audit trail
   - Track: who changed what, when, why
   - Store in database for compliance

### WEEK 2 - High Priority
1. **Knowledge Review Dashboard**
   - Centralized interface for knowledge curation
   - Queue sorted by confidence
   - Atom detail view with source messages
   - One-click approve/reject/merge

2. **Deduplication & Merging**
   - Implement find_similar_atoms() service
   - Add POST /atoms/{id}/merge-into/{target_id}
   - Build MergeDialog UI

3. **Topic Consolidation**
   - Allow merging similar topics
   - Move atoms between topics
   - Archive source topics

### WEEKS 3+ - Enhancement
1. Custom extraction rules (per project)
2. Multi-language support
3. Knowledge export/reports
4. Knowledge graph visualization
