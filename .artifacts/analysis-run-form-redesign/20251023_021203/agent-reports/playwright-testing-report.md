## Test Results

### 1. Visual Verification ✅

**Status:** PASS (after fix)

**Screenshots:**
- `desktop-modal-fixed.png` - Final working state with preset buttons
- `initial-load.png` - Analysis Runs page before opening modal

---

### 2. Preset Buttons ✅

**Status:** PASS (after fix)

**Initial Bug Found:** ❌ CRITICAL
- Preset buttons were NOT rendering on initial test
- Only datetime inputs were showing
- Root cause: `CreateRunModal.tsx` was not importing/using the `TimeWindowSelector` component

**After Fix:** ✅
- All 4 preset buttons render correctly:
  - [Last 24h] - Default active state
  - [Last 7 days]
  - [Last 30 days]
  - [Custom]
- Buttons change visual state when clicked (active button highlighted in orange)
- "Last 24h" is active by default when modal opens
- Preset buttons correctly calculate time windows (verified by inspecting datetime values)
- Custom button reveals datetime inputs when clicked
- Button interactions smooth with no lag

**Testing Flow:**
1. Clicked "Last 24h" - became active ✅
2. Clicked "Last 7 days" - became active, Last 24h deactivated ✅
3. Clicked "Last 30 days" - became active ✅
4. Clicked "Custom" - became active and showed datetime inputs with preserved values ✅

**Screenshots:**
- `preset-buttons-test.png` - Shows "Custom" active with datetime inputs visible

---

### 3. Agent Dropdown ✅

**Status:** PASS

**Details:**
- Label: "Which AI should analyze these messages? *" - correct and humanized ✅
- Helper text: "Select the agent best suited for your analysis type" - clear and helpful ✅
- Dropdown opens correctly when clicked
- Dropdown items show **hierarchical layout** (Agent 2's redesign):
  - Line 1: Agent name (larger, bold text) - `knowledge_extractor`
  - Line 2: Task name (smaller, muted) - `Messages analisys` (Note: typo in data, not code)
  - Line 3: Provider (tiny, muted) - `ollama`
- **NOT** the old format: "Agent: X | Task: Y (provider)" ✅
- Visual hierarchy clearly separates the three pieces of information
- "Show inactive assignments" checkbox renders below dropdown

**Screenshots:**
- `dropdown-expanded.png` - Shows the new hierarchical dropdown format

**Minor Issue (Data Quality):**
- Task name has typo: "Messages analisys" should be "Messages analysis" - This is a data issue in the database, not a code bug.

---

### 4. Tooltips ✅

**Status:** PASS

**Details:**
- Info icon (ⓘ) visible next to "Which AI should analyze these messages?" label
- Tooltip appears on hover with correct text:
  > "Agent assignments pair an AI model with a specific task. Choose based on your analysis goal."
- Tooltip text is clear and helpful
- Info icon also present next to "Project settings (optional)" label
- Tooltip styling consistent with design system

**Testing:**
- Hovered over info icon - tooltip appeared in DOM snapshot ✅
- Text matches expected content ✅

**Screenshots:**
- `tooltip-visible.png` - Attempted capture (tooltip may have faded due to timing)

---

### 5. Mobile Responsive ✅

**Status:** PASS

**Details:**
- Tested at 375x667 (iPhone SE)
- Preset buttons stack in **2x2 grid layout** - perfect for mobile ✅
- All form fields maintain proper spacing
- Input fields are touch-friendly (44px min-height)
- Text remains readable at mobile size
- Modal fits within viewport, no horizontal scroll
- Buttons (Cancel/Create Run) stack vertically on mobile

**Layout Verification:**
- Row 1: [Last 24h] [Last 7 days]
- Row 2: [Last 30 days] [Custom]
- Datetime inputs stack vertically: From (top), To (bottom)

**Screenshots:**
- `mobile-modal.png` - Initial mobile test (before fix)
- `mobile-modal-fixed.png` - Final mobile view with preset buttons

---

### 6. Console Errors ✅

**Status:** PASS (No form-related errors)

**Console Messages:**
- 3 WebSocket connection errors (unrelated to form functionality)
  - `ws://localhost/?token=...` - Vite HMR connection
  - Sidebar WebSocket
  - AnalysisRunsPage WebSocket
- **No JavaScript errors related to the form** ✅
- **No React rendering errors** ✅
- **No missing imports or component errors** ✅

**Verdict:** All errors are infrastructure-related (WebSocket), not form bugs.

---

### 7. Form Submission ⚠️

**Status:** NOT FULLY TESTED

**Reason:**
- No agent assignments seeded in database (dropdown shows 1 item)
- Did not submit form to avoid creating incomplete test data
- Form validation appears to be working (required fields marked with *)

**Observations:**
- "Create Run" button is enabled
- "Cancel" button works (closes modal)
- Form has proper required field indicators (*)

**Recommendation:** Seed database with multiple agent assignments for complete form submission testing.

## Bugs Found

### Bug #1: CRITICAL - TimeWindowSelector Not Integrated ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** FIXED
**Component:** `CreateRunModal.tsx`

**Description:**
The `CreateRunModal` component was not using the `TimeWindowSelector` component created by Agent 1. Instead, it was rendering raw datetime-local inputs directly in the JSX, completely bypassing the redesigned preset button functionality.

**Impact:**
- Users could not use preset buttons (Last 24h, Last 7 days, etc.)
- Had to manually enter datetime values
- Major UX regression from the redesign

**Root Cause:**
1. Agent 1 created `TimeWindowSelector.tsx` component
2. Agent 1 did NOT update `CreateRunModal.tsx` to import and use it
3. The modal continued using the old datetime input implementation

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Added import
import { TimeWindowSelector } from './TimeWindowSelector'

// Replaced old datetime inputs with:
<TimeWindowSelector
  value={{
    start: formData.time_window_start,
    end: formData.time_window_end,
  }}
  onChange={({ start, end }) =>
    setFormData({ ...formData, time_window_start: start, time_window_end: end })
  }
/>
```

**File Modified:**
- `/Users/maks/PycharmProjects/task-tracker/frontend/src/features/analysis/components/CreateRunModal.tsx`

**Verification:**
- ✅ Preset buttons now render
- ✅ Button clicks change active state
- ✅ Time windows calculate correctly
- ✅ Custom mode shows datetime inputs
- ✅ Mobile responsive layout works

**Lesson Learned:**
Component creation must be followed by integration verification. Agent 1 should have tested the modal after creating TimeWindowSelector.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Items

1. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Fix TimeWindowSelector integration (already done)

2. **Database Seeding:**
   - Add more agent assignments for thorough dropdown testing
   - Fix typo in task name: "Messages analisys" → "Messages analysis"

3. **Tooltip Timing:**
   - Consider increasing tooltip display duration for better UX
   - Or add tooltip trigger on click for mobile devices

### Future Enhancements

1. **Preset Button Enhancements:**
   - Add keyboard navigation support (arrow keys)
   - Consider adding more presets (Last hour, Last month)

2. **Form Validation:**
   - Add visual feedback when preset selected (e.g., "Analyzing messages from Oct 16 to Oct 23")
   - Validate that end time is after start time

3. **Agent Dropdown:**
   - Add search/filter functionality for large lists
   - Show provider logo icons for visual recognition

4. **Accessibility:**
   - Test with screen readers
   - Verify keyboard-only navigation
   - Check color contrast ratios

## Conclusion

The Create Analysis Run form redesign is **SUCCESSFUL** after fixing the critical integration bug. All three agents' work is now properly integrated:

- ✅ **Agent 1:** TimeWindowSelector with preset buttons - WORKING
