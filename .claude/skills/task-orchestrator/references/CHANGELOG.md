- architecture: Architecture review and compliance
- documentation: Documentation creation
- exploration: Codebase exploration and search

**Execution Rules:**
- Maximum 4 parallel agents globally
- Graceful degradation with fallback agents
- Unknown tasks route to general-purpose agent

**Artifact Management:**
- Base directory: `.artifacts`
