# 🔗 Session Integration

**After completing your work, integrate findings into active session (if exists):**

## Step 1: Check for Active Session

```bash
active_session=$(ls .claude/sessions/active/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
```

## Step 2: Append Your Report (if session exists)

```bash
if [ -n "$active_session" ]; then
  # Use the helper script
  .claude/scripts/update-active-session.sh "[AGENT_NAME]" your_report.md

  # OR manually append:
  echo -e "\n---\n" >> "$active_session"
  echo "## Agent Report: $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') - [AGENT_NAME]" >> "$active_session"
  echo "" >> "$active_session"
  cat your_report.md >> "$active_session"

  echo "✅ Findings appended to active session"
else
  echo "⚠️  No active session - creating standalone artifact"
  # Save report to project root or .artifacts/
fi
```

## Step 3: Update TodoWrite (if new tasks discovered)

If your work revealed new tasks:
```markdown
Use TodoWrite tool to add discovered tasks.
This triggers auto-save automatically.
```

## Step 4: Report Status

Include in your final output:
```markdown
✅ Work complete. Findings appended to: [session_file_path]
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero orphaned artifact files
- ✅ Automatic context preservation
- ✅ Coordinator doesn't need manual merge
